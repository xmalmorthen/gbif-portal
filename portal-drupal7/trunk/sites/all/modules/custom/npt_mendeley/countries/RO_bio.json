Only two species: G. lacustris and G. costae were found, alone or together, in almost half of the checked sampling stations. Correlation analysis between species and habitat conditions showed that G. lacustris prefers small deep ponds or river banks with steep slopes and it is easily adaptable to habitat changes, while G. costae is mostly found in large marshes with low, stagnant water and high amount of vegetation. Both species are relatively tolerant to human impact in their habitat, with an advantage to G. lacustris. The two species are negatively correlated to each other, as an expression to the competition between them. PCA resulted in two dominant factors explaining almost 60% of the habitat variation, and their graphical representation proved the previous correlations.","uuid":"a40f53f1-cd52-397d-8717-c84f34c3e444","authors":[{"forename":"Horea","surname":"Olosutean"},{"forename":"Daniela Minodora","surname":"Ilie"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Transylvanian Review of Systematical and Ecological Research","firstAuthor":"Olosutean"}]
