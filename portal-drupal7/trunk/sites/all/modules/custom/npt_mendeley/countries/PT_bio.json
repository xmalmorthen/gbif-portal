Harvestmen accessible datasets in Iberian Peninsula are unknown, an only two other datasets available in GBIF are composed exclusively of harvestmen records. Moreover, only a few harvestmen data from Iberian Peninsula are available in GBIF network (or in any network that allows public retrieval or use these data). This paper describes the data associated with the Opiliones kept in the BOS Arthropod Collection of the University of Oviedo, Spain (hosted in the Department of Biolog\u00eda de Organismos y Sistemas), filling some of those gaps. The specimens were mainly collected from the northern third of the Iberian Peninsula. The earliest specimen deposited in the collection, dating back to the early 20th century, belongs to the P. Franganillo Collection. The dataset documents the collection of 16,455 specimens, preserved in 3,772 vials. Approximately 38% of the specimens belong to the family Sclerosomatidae, and 26% to Phalangidae; six other families with fewer specimens are also included. Data quality control was incorporated at several steps of digitisation process to facilitate reuse and improve accuracy. The complete dataset is also provided in Darwin Core Archive format, allowing public retrieval, use and combination with other biological, biodiversity of geographical variables datasets.","uuid":"2b029879-1831-3f36-bd09-e19ee1dd96b1","authors":[{"forename":"Izaskun","surname":"Merino-S\u00e1inz"},{"forename":"Araceli","surname":"Anad\u00f3n"},{"forename":"Antonio","surname":"Torralba-Burrial"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"ZooKeys","firstAuthor":"Merino-S\u00e1inz"},{"id":"6016483364","title":"Niche conservatism and the potential for the crayfish Procambarus clarkii to invade South America","type":"Journal Article","url":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/fwb.12134","tags":["2013","Aichi_B","BR","Brazil","freshwater","GBIF_used","GBits_8","invasive","maxent","Mexico_biodiversity","niche_modeling","Portugal_biodiversity","SDM","Spain_biodiversity","Target_9","USA_biodiversity"],"keywords":["biodiversity conservation","crayfish alien species","invasive species","neotropical conservation","species distribution modelling"],"year":"2013","abstract":"1. Invasive species are one of the most severe threats to biodiversity, and an ability to predict the extent of potential invasions can help conservation strategies. Species distribution models (SDMs) have been widely used to project the potential range of invasive species. These models assume that species retain their niche properties during invasion (niche conservatism), although this assumption is seldom verified. 2. We gathered occurrence records for the crayfish Procambarus clarkii from the U.S.A. and Mexico (native + invasive ranges) and from the Iberian Peninsula (invasive) to test for niche conservatism across continents using niche overlap metrics (Schoener\u2019s D). To test for differences in the climate space occupied by the species on the different continents, we performed two principal component analyses (PCAs) on the environmental data extracted from occurrence records: first, separately for each occurrence data set (i.e. each continent) and secondly, using the pooled data. Subsequently, we projected the model to South America, where this species has the potential to become invasive. 3. Schoener\u2019s D showed high overlap (0.68) between the two regions (the Americas and Iberia), and there was no difference between the regions in both PCAs. The crayfish has conserved its niche across continents, and therefore, our model projection to South America may accurately demonstrate where invasion is most likely to occur. 4. Large parts of South America are apparently suitable, mainly Argentina, Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay and southern Brazil. This result is of great concern since this invasive species can spread quickly in suitable areas. Stronger laws and regulations should be made to protect native biodiversity and agri- cultural land. Our approach could be replicated for the study of invasions by other species where extensive data on the potentially invaded areas are available.","uuid":"9b1135e2-d20a-30f4-8363-473aad2446a4","authors":[{"forename":"Alexandre V.","surname":"Palaoro"},{"forename":"Marcelo M.","surname":"Dalosto"},{"forename":"Gabriel C.","surname":"Costa"},{"forename":"Sandro","surname":"Santos"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Palaoro"},{"id":"6016482074","title":"Post-glacial dispersal, rather than in situ glacial survival, best explains the disjunct distribution of the Lusitanian plant species Daboecia cantabrica (Ericaceae)","type":"Journal Article","volume":"online","url":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/j.1365-2699.2012.02789.x","tags":["2012","Aichi_E","GB","GBIF_used","Ireland_biodiversity","Portugal_biodiversity","Spain_biodiversity","Target_19"],"keywords":["Daboecia cantabrica","devensian glaciations","Ireland","last glacial maximum","Lusitanian flora","palaeodistribution modelling","phylogeography","Spain"],"year":"2012","abstract":"Aim The distribution of the Lusitanian flora and fauna, species which are found only in southern and western Ireland and in northern Spain and Portugal but which are absent from intervening countries, represents one of the classic conundrums of biogeography. The aim of the present study was to determine whether the distribution of the Lusitanian plant species Daboecia cantabrica was due to persistence in separate Irish and Iberian refugia, or has resulted from post-glacial recolonization followed by subsequent extinction of intervening populations. Location Northern Spain and Co. Galway, western Ireland. Methods Palaeodistribution modelling using Maxent was employed to iden- tify putative refugial areas for D. cantabrica at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Phylogeographical analysis of samples from 64 locations in Ireland and Spain were carried out using a chloroplast marker (atpB\u2013rbcL), the nuclear ITS region, and an anonymous nuclear single-copy locus. Results The palaeodistribution model indicated areas with a high probability of survival for D. cantabrica at the LGM off the western coast of Galicia in Spain, and in the Bay of Biscay. Spanish populations exhibited substantially higher genetic diversity than Irish populations at all three loci, as well as geo- graphical structuring of haplotypes within Spain consistent with divergence in separate refugia. Spanish populations also exhibited far more endemic haplo- types. Divergence time between Irish and Spanish populations associated with the putative Biscay refugium was estimated as 3.333\u201332 ka. Main conclusions Our data indicate persistence by D. cantabrica throughout the LGM in two separate southern refugia: one in western Galicia and one in the area off the coast of western France which now lies in the Bay of Biscay. Spain was recolonized from both refugia, whilst Ireland was most likely recol- onized from the Biscay refugium. On the balance of evidence across the three marker types and the palaeodistribution modelling, our findings do not sup- port the idea of in situ survival of D. cantabrica in Ireland, contrary to earlier suggestions. The fact that we cannot conclusively rule out the existence of a small, more northerly refugium, however, highlights the need for further analy- sis of Lusitanian plant species.","uuid":"3d43665e-8b9d-396d-b0cf-43f2d296346a","authors":[{"forename":"Gemma E.","surname":"Beatty"},{"forename":"Jim","surname":"Provan"}],"editors":[{"forename":"Hans-Peter","surname":"Comes"}],"publication_outlet":"Journal of Biogeography","firstAuthor":"Beatty"},{"id":"6016482414","title":"Inverted patterns of genetic diversity in continental and island populations of the heather Erica scoparia s.l.","type":"Journal Article","volume":"39","issue":"3","url":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/j.1365-2699.2011.02622.x","tags":["2012","BE","Belgium","conservation","ES","Europe_biodiversity","France_biodiversity","GB","GBIF_used","GBIF_VIP","museum","niche_modeling","Portugal_biodiversity","SDM","Spain","Spain_biodiversity","university"],"keywords":["azores","dispersal","endemism","island biogeography","isolation by distance","macaronesia","spatial autocorrelation","spatial genetic structure","speciation"],"pages":"574-584","year":"2012","abstract":"Aim Using the heather Erica scoparia s.l. as a model, this paper aims to test theoretical predictions that island populations are genetically less diverse than continental ones and to determine the extent to which island and continental populations are connected by pollen- and seed-mediated gene flow. Location Macaronesia, Mediterranean, Atlantic fringe of Europe. Methods Patterns of genetic diversity are described based on variation at two chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) loci and one nuclear DNA (nDNA) locus for 109 accessions across the entire distribution range of the species. Global patterns of genetic differentiation were investigated using principal coordinates analysis. Genetic differentiation between island and continental areas, estimations of pollen- and seed-mediated gene flow, and the presence of phylogeographical signal were assessed by means of Fst\/NST (continental scale) and Fij\/Nij (local scale). Extant and past distribution ranges of the species were inferred from niche modelling using layers describing present and Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) macroclimatic conditions. Results The Azores exhibited a significantly higher genetic diversity than the continent. The lowest levels of genetic differentiation were observed between the Azores and the western Mediterranean, and the diversity observed in the Azores resulted from at least two colonization waves. Within the Azores, kinship coefficients showed a significant and much steeper decrease with geographical distance in the cpDNA than in the nDNA. The distribution predicted by LGM models was markedly different from the current potential distribution, particularly in western Europe, where no suitable areas were predicted by LGM models, and along the Atlantic coast of the African continent, where LGM models predicted highly suitable climatic conditions. Main conclusions The higher diversity observed in Azorean than in continental populations is inconsistent with MacArthur and Wilson\u2019s equilibrium model and derived theoretical population genetic expectations. This inverted pattern may be the result of extinction on the continent coupled with multiple island colonization events and subsequent allopatric diversification and lineage hybridization in the Azores. The results highlight the role of allopatric diversification in explaining diversification on islands and suggest that this process has played a much more significant role in shaping Azorean biodiversity than previously thought.","uuid":"29778d10-33ff-3fe2-a049-6c1e6afc42ee","authors":[{"forename":"Aur\u00e9lie","surname":"D\u00e9samor\u00e9"},{"forename":"B.","surname":"Laenen"},{"forename":"Juana-Mar\u00eda","surname":"Gonz\u00e1lez-Mancebo"},{"forename":"R.","surname":"Ja\u00e9n Molina"},{"forename":"Nadia","surname":"Bystriakova"},{"forename":"E.","surname":"Martinez-Klimova"},{"forename":"M.
