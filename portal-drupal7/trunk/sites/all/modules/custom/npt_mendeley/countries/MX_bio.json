Invasive species are one of the most severe threats to biodiversity, and an ability to predict the extent of potential invasions can help conservation strategies. Species distribution models (SDMs) have been widely used to project the potential range of invasive species. These models assume that species retain their niche properties during invasion (niche conservatism), although this assumption is seldom verified. 2. We gathered occurrence records for the crayfish Procambarus clarkii from the U.S.A. and Mexico (native + invasive ranges) and from the Iberian Peninsula (invasive) to test for niche conservatism across continents using niche overlap metrics (Schoener\u2019s D). To test for differences in the climate space occupied by the species on the different continents, we performed two principal component analyses (PCAs) on the environmental data extracted from occurrence records: first, separately for each occurrence data set (i.e. each continent) and secondly, using the pooled data. Subsequently, we projected the model to South America, where this species has the potential to become invasive. 3. Schoener\u2019s D showed high overlap (0.68) between the two regions (the Americas and Iberia), and there was no difference between the regions in both PCAs. The crayfish has conserved its niche across continents, and therefore, our model projection to South America may accurately demonstrate where invasion is most likely to occur. 4. Large parts of South America are apparently suitable, mainly Argentina, Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay and southern Brazil. This result is of great concern since this invasive species can spread quickly in suitable areas. Stronger laws and regulations should be made to protect native biodiversity and agri- cultural land. Our approach could be replicated for the study of invasions by other species where extensive data on the potentially invaded areas are available.","uuid":"9b1135e2-d20a-30f4-8363-473aad2446a4","authors":[{"forename":"Alexandre V.","surname":"Palaoro"},{"forename":"Marcelo M.","surname":"Dalosto"},{"forename":"Gabriel C.","surname":"Costa"},{"forename":"Sandro","surname":"Santos"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Palaoro"},{"id":"6016482264","title":"Genetic, phenotypic and ecological divergence with gene flow at the Isthmus of Tehuantepec: the case of the azure-crowned hummingbird ( Amazilia cyanocephala )","type":"Journal Article","url":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/jbi.12093","tags":["2013","Aichi_E","birds","GBIF_used","GBits_8","in_press","Mexico","Mexico_biodiversity","MX","niche_modeling","SDM","Target_19"],"keywords":["Amazilia cyanocephala","gene flow","genetic differentiation","Isthmus of Tehuantepec","Mexico","morphological variation","niche divergence","Pleistocene","selection"],"year":"2013","abstract":"Aim We test whether populations of the Mesoamerican azure-crowned hum- mingbird, Amazilia cyanocephala (Trochilidae), located east and west of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec are genetically, morphologically and environmentally differentiated and examine the relative role of drift and selection in driving diversification.

Habitat distribution (niche) models based on known occurrences provide geographical structure for such management as the environmental factors change. 2 Bark beetles play critical roles in coniferous forest dynamics in western North America. Among these insects, Dendroctonus rhizophagus Thomas and Bright, which occurs in the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico, is unique in that it attacks only immature trees (Pinus spp.) and therefore represents a threat to forest regeneration. We developed current habitat distribution models for D. rhizophagus and its Pinus hosts and projected these to future climate scenarios. 3 Predicted suitable habitat of D. rhizophagus currently covers approximately 119 000 km2 of which approximately 11% is occupied, and overlap with suitable habitat for all Pinus hosts exceeds 99.5%. Some suitable habitat occurs isolated from known D. rhizophagus occurrences in Mexico and the south-western U.S.A. 4 Habitat distribution models were projected to four potential climate scenarios for the period 2040\u20132060 and this predicted the gains and losses of suitable D. rhizophagus habitat throughout the region. Areas of north-western Mexico maintain large areas of suitable D. rhizophagus and Pinus host habitat in all scenarios. Dispersal to isolated areas of D. rhizophagus habitat appears unlikely. 5 The results of the present study can be used to target D. rhizophagus monitoring and management activities and may serve as a model for the management of other invasive species.","uuid":"190ede1d-80b5-35d6-ad3f-4738db47437a","authors":[{"forename":"Steven E.","surname":"Smith"},{"forename":"Ma.

Although there are no natural protected areas in Guerrero, it has suitable habitat for the jaguar, a common species used for planning and management of conservation areas. Since, there is actual evidence that environmental and anthropogenic variables may modify vertebrate species distribution with time, in this study we predicted the potential distribution of Panthera onca using MaxEnt for this Southeastern region. In addition, we made a projection considering the effect of a moderate climate change scenario, to evaluate the stability of the conservation area for a period of 24 years. Furthermore, we applied three threat scenarios for the actual prediction to define conservation priorities areas. In our results, we have found that 18 361Km2 (29%) of this state has a permanent suitable habitat for jaguar conservation in the Sierra Madre del Sur and Pacific coast, with a possible loss of 2 000km2 in 24 years. This habitat is characterized by a 56% of temperate forest (mainly conifers and hardwoods 34%), and 35% of tropical deciduous forest. With the projections, the Southeastern region resulted with the higher anthropogenic impacts, while at the same time, an area of 7 900km2 in the Central-Western state was determined as a priority for conservation. To assure jaguar conservation, we propose the inclusion of this new conservation area, which is located in the Sierra Madre del Sur, with which we may potentially preserve other 250 species of threatened vertebrates. This way, the suggested habitat conservation may represent a local effort in Guerrero and will strengthen the biological corridor network for P. onca protection in Latin America.","uuid":"ff141ca6-2b43-365f-ae5e-0e9532b82a8c","authors":[{"forename":"Angela P.","surname":"Cuervo-Robayo"},{"forename":"Octavio","surname":"Monroy-Vilchis"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Cuervo-Robayo"},{"id":"6016481374","title":"Potential distribution of American black bears in northwest Mexico and implications for their conservation","type":"Journal Article","volume":"23","issue":"1","url":"http:\/\/www.bioone.org\/doi\/abs\/10.2192\/URSUS-D-11-00007.1","tags":["2012","Aichi_C","conservation","GBIF_used","Mexico","Mexico_biodiversity","MX","species distribution","Target_12"],"keywords":["american black bear","distribution","ecological niche","mexico","sierra madre occidental","sky island"],"pages":"65-77","year":"2012","abstract":"Defining areas of potential distribution for large carnivores is a critical step for generating conservation strategies. Ecological niche modelling is an important tool for identifying potential areas for conservation of carnivores, such as American black bears (Ursus americanus) in the Sierra Madre Occidental (SMOcc) and the Sky Islands (SI) region of Northwest Mexico. Our objective was to define areas and environmental factors that influence bear distribution and understand the causes of their absence. We used GARP (genetic algorithm for rule-set prediction) to define the potential area of distribution using historical and current records of black bear (n 5 582) and 23 bioclimatic and physical variables. We obtained a consensus model with a high probability of occurrence and power prediction representing 80% of the SMOcc (221,078 km2), including the SI region (Sonora and Chihuahua deserts). The ecological dimensions of the model include temperate dry and mixed forest, low rainfall, low temperatures, and elevation above 1,500 m, with considerable slope variation. Information provided by residents of Aguascalientes, Chihuahua, Durango, and Zacatecas indicate that the species was extirpated in central and southwest Durango and Zacatecas about 50 years ago, coinciding with the use of 1080 poison (sodium fluoroacetate) to eradicate livestock predators, combined with habitat loss, fragmentation, and excessive hunting in the region. These factors precipitated the regional extirpation of the species. Areas such as those we have identified may be important sites for the reintroduction of black bears.","uuid":"a000664b-8188-3fb8-ab4e-4a617342f755","authors":[{"forename":"Christian Alejandro","surname":"Delf\u00edn-Alfonso"},{"forename":"Carlos Alberto","surname":"L\u00f3pez-gonz\u00e1lez"},{"forename":"Miguel","surname":"Equihua"},{"forename":"Christian","surname":"Alejandro"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Ursus","firstAuthor":"Delf\u00edn-Alfonso"},{"id":"6016483134","title":"Diversity and distribution of genus Jatropha in Mexico","type":"Journal Article","issue":"1979","url":"http:\/\/www.springerlink.com\/index\/10.1007\/s10722-012-9906-7","tags":["2012","agriculture","Aichi_C","biofuel","GBIF_used","Mexico_biodiversity","plants","Target_13","US"],"keywords":["biodiversity","biogeography","cluster analysis","Jatropha","species richness"],"year":"2012","abstract":"In Mexico and all over the world, the number of studies on the species of the Jatropha genus has increased because of the use of its seed oil to produce biodiesel.

Species such as J. dioica, J. curcas, J. cordata, J. cinerea and J. gaumeri are distributed in areas with well defined environmental conditions. However, the distribution of species such as J. riojae has not yet been ascertained. Three areas with high species richness were identified, and they are very important for the study and conservation of the genus. Mexico is a global center of diversity for this genus.

Lack of knowledge of its distribution has generated confusion over the assignment of the correct risk category. With the aim of predicting the distribution area of the Bearded Wood Partridge and contributing to strategies for its conservation, we updated and extended the knowledge of its distribution by modelling its ecological niche using GARP and MaxEnt algorithms. We also analysed its environmental distribution using principal components analysis, and contrasted the two most important environmental variables with the species\u2019s distribution based on vegetation type. We found that the area potentially occupied by this species covers 17,956 km2 according to GARP and 12,974 km2 according to MaxEnt. We suggest that there is a biogeographic barrier which limits the distribution of this species in the southern part of its range. The abiotic variables that best explain its distribution are average annual precipitation and elevation, both of which coincide well with the distribution of cloud forest. A redefinition of the current range as recognised by IUCN is proposed along with the need to change its national risk category.","uuid":"e41ff934-5afd-3b68-a5e1-b674620ad669","authors":[{"forename":"Claudio","surname":"Mota-Vargas"},{"forename":"Octavio R.","surname":"Rojas-Soto"},{"forename":"Carlos","surname":"Lara"},{"forename":"Citlalli","surname":"Castillo-Guevara"},{"forename":"Claudia","surname":"Ballesteros-Barrera"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Bird Conservation International","firstAuthor":"Mota-Vargas"},{"id":"6016484564","title":"The performance of range maps and species distribution models representing the geographic variation of species richness at different resolutions","type":"Journal Article","volume":"21","issue":"9","url":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/j.1466-8238.2011.00741.x","tags":["2012","conservation","ES","GBIF_used","macroecology","Mexico_biodiversity","museum","niche_modeling","SDM","Spain"],"keywords":["Amphibians","MaxEnt","Mexico","range maps","spatial scale","species distribution models","species richness patterns"],"pages":"935-944","year":"2012","abstract":"Aim The method used to generate hypotheses about species distributions, in addition to spatial scale,may affect the biodiversity patterns that are then observed.

Ten, the centroid of the distributions was calculated in ecological space (niche centroid) and the multidimensional Euclidian ecological distance of each pixel to the niche centroid was estimated. Finally, for each region the distance to the niche centroid (DNC) was regressed against 14 independent occurrence points in each site containing white-tailed deer density information to determine the function describing the DNC-density relationship, which was used to generate maps describing the distribution of white-tailed deer density. Our results indicated an inverse DNC-density relationship in both regions (Balsas Basin: r2 \ue035 0.90 and Tehuac\u00e1n- Cuicatl\u00e1n: r2 \ue035 0.76) that was validated via bootstrapping resulting in a predicting capacity of near 62% for Balsas Basin and 65% for Tehuac\u00e1n-Cuicatl\u00e1n Valley. Our results suggest that the distance to the niche centroid method is a robust, science-based correlative approach that resulted useful to predict the population density of the white-tailed deer in a spa- tially explicit fashion.

These data demonstrate that N-6-benzylaminopurine is more effective than kinetin in inducing buds, and that glucose plays an important role as an inhibitory signalling molecule for the bud induction process that is mediated by cytokinins in the moss B. billarderi.","uuid":"e9c0d41e-2b97-3ac1-97ae-4a75839e597a","authors":[{"forename":"Arturo Mart\u00ednez","surname":"Zavala"},{"forename":"Netzahualcoyotl Mayek","surname":"P\u00e9rez"},{"forename":"Analilia Arroyo","surname":"Becerra"},{"forename":"Miguel Angel Villalobos","surname":"L\u00f3pez"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Central European Journal of Biology","firstAuthor":"Zavala"},{"id":"6016480374","title":"Molecular and morphological support for a Florida origin of the Cuban oak","type":"Journal Article","volume":"online","url":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/j.1365-2699.2011.02610.x","tags":["2011","biogeography","Central America_biodiversity","Cuba_biodiversity","GBIF_used","in_press","Mexico_biodiversity","university","US","USA_biodiversity"],"keywords":["cpDNA","Cuba","founder effect","morphology","nuclear microsatellites","over-water dispersal","phylogeography","Quercus oleoides","Quercus sagraeana","Quercus virginiana"],"pages":"no-no","year":"2011","abstract":"Aim The origins of the Cuban biota are of long-standing interest in biogeography, and the source of a small live oak (Quercus series Virentes) population on Cuba remains unresolved. Based on morphological evidence, previous authors have hypothesized a Florida origin from either Q. geminata or Q. virginiana or both; a Mexican origin from Q. oleoides; or a hybrid origin from both sources. We use molecular data and taxonomically informative leaf morphology to identify the source species and timing of colonization. Location Cuba, Central America, Mexico and the south-eastern United States. Methods We collected representative samples of Cuban oaks and each putative source species and genotyped each sample at 12 nuclear microsatellites and two chloroplast DNA sequences. We estimated population structure using a Bayesian clustering analysis and F-statistics, pairwise migration rates among taxa, and divergence time using an isolation-with-migration model. We measured seven leaf traits and conducted an analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) to determine which putative source species was most similar to Cuban oaks. Results Cuban oak contains one chloroplast DNA haplotype, which is common in southern Florida. Bayesian clustering analysis of microsatellites revealed that the Cuban oak forms a distinct and pure population cluster, and F-statistics showed that Cuban oaks are differentiated least from Q. virginiana and most from Q. geminata. Migration rates were highest out of Cuba to Q. oleoides. Molecular diversity, the ratio of allelic richness to allele size range, and effective population size of the Cuban oak were relatively low, suggesting a founder effect. Divergence time estimates fell entirely within the Pleistocene (628\u20136 ka), considering a range of mutation rates and generation times. Cuban oaks were morphologically most similar to Q. virginiana and least similar to Q. geminata. Main conclusions Molecular and morphological data support a Pleistocene dispersal of Q. virginiana from Florida to Cuba, followed by isolation and divergence, then limited dispersal and introgression from Cuba to Q. oleoides in Central America. Birds could have dispersed acorns to Cuba during a glacial period when sea levels were low. These results highlight the varied origin of the Cuban biota and the possible role of Pleistocene glaciations in the establishment of temperate taxa in the tropics.","uuid":"68e75324-87c7-3d06-8748-e3493e5d4359","authors":[{"forename":"Paul Francis","surname":"Gugger"},{"forename":"Jeannine","surname":"Cavender-Bares"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Gugger"},{"id":"6016479364","title":"Predicting potential distribution of the jaguar (Panthera onca) in Mexico: identification of priority areas for conservation","type":"Journal Article","volume":"17","issue":"2","url":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/j.1472-4642.2010.00740.x","tags":["2011","CH","conservation","GBIF_used","IT","Italy","mammals","Mexico","Mexico_biodiversity","MX","niche_modeling","SDM","Switzerland","university"],"keywords":["Consensus methods","ENFA","ensemble model","GBIF_VIP","jaguar conservation","Mahalanobis Distance","Maxent"],"pages":"350-361","year":"2011","abstract":"Aim The jaguar, Panthera onca, is a species of global conservation concern. In Mexico, the northernmost part of its distribution range, its conservation status, is particularly critical, while its potential and actual distribution is poorly known. We propose an ensemble model (EM) of the potential distribution for the jaguar in Mexico and identify the priority areas for conservation. Location Mexico. Methods We generated our EM based on three presence-only methods (Ecological Niche Factor Analysis, Mahalanobis distance, Maxent) and considering environmental, biological and anthropogenic factors. We used this model to evaluate the efficacy of the existing Mexican protected areas (PAs), to evaluate the adequacy of the jaguar conservation units (JCUs) and to propose new areas that should be considered for conservation and management of the species in Mexico. Results Our results outline that 16% of Mexico (c. 312,000 km2) can be considered as suitable for the presence of the jaguar. Furthermore, 13% of the suitable areas are included in existing PAs and 14% are included in JCUs (Sanderson et al., 2002). Main conclusions Clearly much more should be carried out to establish a proactive conservation strategy. Based on our results, we propose here new jaguar conservation and management areas that are important for a nationwide conservation blueprint.","uuid":"85e3601c-8d08-3bd0-9915-9d1215f800db","authors":[{"forename":"Clarita","surname":"Rodr\u00edguez-Soto"},{"forename":"Octavio","surname":"Monroy-Vilchis"},{"forename":"Luigi","surname":"Maiorano"},{"forename":"Luigi","surname":"Boitani"},{"forename":"Juan Carlos","surname":"Faller"},{"forename":"Miguel \u00c1.","surname":"Briones"},{"forename":"Rodrigo","surname":"N\u00fa\u00f1ez"},{"forename":"Octavio","surname":"Rosas-Rosas"},{"forename":"Gerardo","surname":"Ceballos"},{"forename":"Alessandra","surname":"Falcucci"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Diversity and Distributions","firstAuthor":"Rodr\u00edguez-Soto"},{"id":"6016477864","title":"Current distribution and predicted geographic expansion of the Rufous-backed Robin in Mexico: a fading endemism?","type":"Journal Article","volume":"16","tags":["2010","GBIF_used","Mexico","Mexico_biodiversity","MX","USA_biodiversity"],"keywords":["Biological invasions","dispersion  pathways","niche"],"pages":"786-797","year":"2010","abstract":"The Rufous-backed Robin Turdus rufopalliatus is a bird endemic to the Paci\ufb01c slope of Mexico.

Currently, E. adenophorum\u2019s main colonisation area is located in the Yunnan\u2013Guizhou Plateau of China, where it has caused prominent economic and ecological problems. Sixty-three years ago, Crofton weed appeared in Menghai county, Yunnan Province, from where it dispersed northwards and eastwards at an average speed of 20 km year\u22121. The invasion of E. adenophorum nonetheless showed pronounced variations in both time and space. Spread was relatively slow in the initial invasion period between 1940 and 1950, while the most rapid range expansions occurred in the 1980s. Environmental conditions at native and invaded sites were significantly different, reflecting a great adaptability of the species during colonization. These changes were greater than habitat differences between colonized and many adjacent un-colonized sites in Southern China. Therefore, immediate measures are required to stop a further northward and eastward expansion of Crofton weed.","uuid":"1315f37c-e8e1-3931-bef5-b2d9c025c06c","authors":[{"forename":"Weiguo","surname":"Sang"},{"forename":"Li","surname":"Zhu"},{"forename":"Jan","surname":"Axmacher"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Sang"},{"id":"6016475354","title":"Assessing the accuracy of species distribution models to predict amphibian species richness patterns.","type":"Journal Article","volume":"78","issue":"1","url":"http:\/\/www.azoresbioportal.angra.uac.pt\/files\/publicacoes_Pineda  Lobo 2009.pdf\nhttp:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18771504","tags":["2009","Aichi_E","conservation","ES","GBIF_used","Mexico","Mexico_biodiversity","MX","niche_modeling","SDM","Spain","Target_19"],"keywords":["Amphibians","Amphibians: physiology","Animals","Biodiversity","Biological","Mexico","Models"],"pages":"182-90","year":"2009","abstract":"1. Evaluating the distribution of species richness where biodiversity is high but has been insufficiently sampled is not an easy task. Species distribution modelling has become a useful approach for predicting their ranges, based on the relationships between species records and environmental variables. Overlapping predictions of individual distributions could be a useful strategy for obtaining estimates of species richness and composition in a region, but these estimates should be evaluated using a proper validation process, which compares the predicted richness values and composition with accurate data from independent sources. 2. In this study, we propose a simple approach to estimate model performance for several distributional predictions generated simultaneously. This approach is particularly suitable when species distribution modelling techniques that require only presence data are used. 3. The individual distributions for the 370 known amphibian species of Mexico were predicted using maxent to model data on their known presence (66,113 presence-only records). Distributions were subsequently overlapped to obtain a prediction of species richness. Accuracy was assessed by comparing the overall species richness values predicted for the region with observed and predicted values from 118 well-surveyed sites, each with an area of c. 100 km(2), which were identified using species accumulation curves and nonparametric estimators. 4. The derived models revealed a remarkable heterogeneity of species richness across the country, provided information about species composition per site and allowed us to obtain a measure of the spatial distribution of prediction errors. Examining the magnitude and location of model inaccuracies, as well as separately assessing errors of both commission and omission, highlights the inaccuracy of the predictions of species distribution models and the need to provide measures of uncertainty along with the model results. 5. The combination of a species distribution modelling method like maxent and species richness estimators offers a useful tool for identifying when the overall pattern provided by all model predictions might be representing the geographical patterns of species richness and composition, regardless of the particular quality or accuracy of the predictions for each individual species.","uuid":"06628f07-3118-391d-8818-362b1eb7a386","authors":[{"forename":"Eduardo","surname":"Pineda"},{"forename":"Jorge M","surname":"Lobo"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"The Journal of animal ecology","firstAuthor":"Pineda"}]
