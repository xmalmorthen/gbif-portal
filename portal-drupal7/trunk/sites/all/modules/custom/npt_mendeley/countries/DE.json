The supply of pollination is mostly studied at the landscape scale while recent studies on the demand for pollination services provide a global-scale picture based on aggregate national-level data. This paper quantifies both demand and supply of pollination in the European Union (EU) at a relatively high spatial resolution, allowing an analysis of the match between demand and supply. Finally, we evaluate how policies interact with the spatial differences between demand and supply of this ecosystem service. We mapped the crop area requiring pollination for optimal production (demand) and both bee habitat and related visitation probability (supply) using detailed agricultural and landscape data. We compared the maps of demand and supply by visual comparison, descriptive statics and a trend surface generalized additive model to analyze the relation between visitation probability and the presence or absence of pollinator dependent crops. A sensitivity analysis was done to test the robustness of the pollination supply model. Finally, the impact of EU Biodiversity Strategy and Biofuel Directive were evaluated by identifying areas where these policies would influence the demand or supply of pollination. In the EU, 12% of the total cropland area was dependent on pollinators for optimal agricultural produc- tion. Pollinator habitat is especially abundant in mosaic landscapes as found in hilly and mountainous areas. Although covering less than 0.5% of the agricultural area, the presence of green linear elements increased the visitation probability by 5\u201320% while being the sole providers of pollinators in 12% of the croplands. In half of the area with a high pollination demand, the supply of pollination is also high. Irre- spective of the different parameterizations, total habitat areas and visitation probability were highest in croplands without pollinator dependent crops and lowest in hotspots of pollination demand. The analysis of the match between pollination supply and demand for this service indicates that for improving or ensuring pollination one must consider both the demand and supply of the process of crop pollination for optimal results.","uuid":"95fb305f-9876-30a9-90b1-502b19c5242a","authors":[{"forename":"C.J.E.","surname":"Schulp"},{"forename":"S.","surname":"Lautenbach"},{"forename":"P.H.","surname":"Verburg"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Ecological Indicators","firstAuthor":"Schulp"},{"id":"6140653744","title":"Integrating Open Access Geospatial Data to Map the Habitat Suitability of the Declining Corn Bunting (Miliaria calandra)","type":"Journal Article","volume":"2","issue":"4","url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2220-9964\/2\/4\/935\/","tags":["2013","Aichi_E","DE","GBIF_used","GBits_11","Germany","Portugal","PT","SE","Spain_biodiversity","Sweden","Target_19"],"keywords":["agricultural intensification","Corine land cover","corn bunting","Landsat","Miliaria calandra","open access data","open source geospatial software","species distribution modeling"],"pages":"935-954","year":"2013","abstract":"The efficacy of integrating open access geospatial data to produce habitat suitability maps for the corn bunting (Miliaria calandra) was investigated.

Substantial interspecific variation is found in the saccular otoliths, including the presence of a unique otolithic \"spur\" in the genera Melamphaes and Poromitra. The variation in the saccular otolith is correlated with an increase in the number of hair bundle orientation groups on the sensory epithelia from the genera Scopelogadus to Poromitra to Melamphaes. The diverse structural variations found in the saccule may reflect the evolutionary history of these species. The sensory hair cell bundles in this family have the most variable shapes yet encountered in fish ears. In the saccule, most of the hair bundles are 15-20 \u03bcm high, an exceptional height for fish otolithic end organs. These bundles have large numbers of stereovilli, including some that reach the length of the kinocilium. In the utricle, the striolar region separates into two unusually shaped areas that have not been described in any other vertebrates. The brains in all species have a relatively small olfactory bulb and optic tectum, as well as an enlarged posterior cerebellar region that is likely to be involved in inner ear and lateral line (octavolateral) functions. Data from melamphaids support the hypothesis that specialized anatomical structures are found in the ears of some (if not most) deep-sea fishes, presumably enhancing their hearing sensitivity.

The realized climatic niche of an invasive species can be used to predict its potential distribution in new areas, providing a basis for screening procedures in the compilation of black and white lists to prevent new introductions. We tested this assertion by modeling the realized climatic niche of the Eastern grey squirrel Sciurus carolinensis. Maxent was used to develop three models: one considering only records from the native range (NRM), a second including records from native and invasive range (NIRM), a third calibrated with invasive occurrences and projected in the native range (RCM). Niche conservatism was tested considering both a niche equivalency and a niche similarity test. NRM failed to predict suitable parts of the currently invaded range in Europe, while RCM underestimated the suitability in the native range. NIRM accurately predicted both the native and invasive range. The niche equivalency hypothesis was rejected due to a significant difference between the grey squirrel\u2019s niche in native and invasive ranges. The niche similarity test yielded no significant results. Our analyses support the hypothesis of a shift in the species\u2019 climatic niche in the area of introductions. Species Distribution Models (SDMs) appear to be a useful tool in the compilation of black lists, allowing identifying areas vulnerable to invasions.

We used molecular markers and species distribution models (SDMs) to study the impact of range dynamics on the common wall lizard, Podarcis muralis, from southern refugia to the northern range margin. Location Parts of the Western Palaearctic. Methods We genotyped 10 polymorphic microsatellites in 282 individuals of P. muralis and sequenced the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) cytochrome b gene to study the genetic structure, divergence times and ancestral distribu- tions. Furthermore, we generated SDMs for climate scenarios for 6 and 21 ka derived from two different global circulation models. Results We detected two major mtDNA lineages \u2013 a western France clade (Pyrenees to Brittany), and an eastern France clade (southern France to Germany, Belgium and Luxembourg). This split was dated to c. 1.23 Ma. The latter clade was divided into two subclades, which diverged c. 0.38 Ma. Genetic diversity of microsatellites within each clade was nested and showed a significant loss of genetic diversity from south to north, a strong pattern of allele surfing across nearly all loci, and an increase in genetic differentiation towards the northern range margin. Results from SDMs suggest that southward range retraction during the late glacial period split the distribution into geographically distinct refugia. Main conclusions The strong genetic differentiation mirrors the effects of long-term isolation of P. muralis in multiple refugia. Post-glacial recolonization of Northern Europe has taken place from two distinct refugia, most probably along river systems (Rh^ one, Rhine, Moselle) and along the Atlantic coastline, with subsequent nested elimination of genetic diversity and increasing genetic differentiation at the northern range margin.","uuid":"cf5d167d-6b59-3ec5-91ea-c896ba15ced8","authors":[{"forename":"Franz","surname":"Gassert"},{"forename":"Ulrich","surname":"Schulte"},{"forename":"Martin","surname":"Husemann"},{"forename":"Werner","surname":"Ulrich"},{"forename":"Dennis","surname":"R\u00f6dder"},{"forename":"Axel","surname":"Hochkirch"},{"forename":"Edm\u00e9e","surname":"Engel"},{"forename":"Jobst","surname":"Meyer"},{"forename":"Jan Christian","surname":"Habel"}],"editors":[{"forename":"Aristeidis","surname":"Parmakelis"}],"publication_outlet":"Journal of Biogeography","firstAuthor":"Gassert"},{"id":"6136778544","title":"Epilobium brachycarpum: a fast-spreading neophyte in Germany","type":"Journal Article","volume":"33","url":"http:\/\/www.tuexenia.de\/fileadmin\/website\/downloads\/Tuexenia33\/11Gregor-etal_Tuexenia33.pdf","tags":["2013","Aichi_B","DE","GBIF_used","GBits_10","Germany","invasive","Maxent","North America_biodiversity","SDM","Target_9"],"keywords":["invasive species","neophyte","Sisymbrion","transformer","weed"],"pages":"259-283","year":"2013","abstract":"Only a small proportion of introduced plant species become invasive and may eventually create eco- logical or economic problems.

Results from all analyses are mostly congruent and reveal 1) a split between European and North African populations, 2) rather low divergence between populations from the eastern and western part of North Africa (Morocco vs. Tunisia), 3) a lack of differentiation between the oasis and Atlas Mountain populations, 4) as well as among the oasis populations, and 5) no reduction of genetic variability in oasis populations. However, one exception to this general trend resulted from the analyses of wing shape; wings of butterflies from oases are more elongated compared with those from the other habitats. This pattern of phenotypic divergence may suggest a recent colonization of the oasis habitats by individuals, which might be accompanied by a rather dispersive behavior. Species distribution modeling suggests a fairly recent reexpansion of the species' climatic niche starting in the Holocene at about 6000 before present. The combined results indicate a rather recent colonization of the oases by highly mobile individuals from genetically diverse founder populations. The colonization was likely followed by the expansion and persistence of these founder populations under relatively stable environmental conditions. This, together with low rates of gene flow, likely prevented differentiation of populations via drift and led to the maintenance of high genetic diversity.","uuid":"516480b9-c315-313a-8ae8-7aec2ff31bc6","authors":[{"forename":"Jan Christian","surname":"Habel"},{"forename":"Martin","surname":"Husemann"},{"forename":"Thomas","surname":"Schmitt"},{"forename":"Leonardo","surname":"Dapporto"},{"forename":"Dennis","surname":"R\u00f6dder"},{"forename":"Sofie","surname":"Vandewoestijne"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"The Journal of heredity","firstAuthor":"Habel"},{"id":"6075429854","title":"The diverse habitats of Hygrocybe \u2013 peeking into an enigmatic lifestyle","type":"Journal Article","volume":"4","issue":"4","url":"http:\/\/www.mycosphere.org\/","tags":["2013","Aichi_E","biodiversity","DE","GB","GBIF_used","GBits_10","Germany","global_biodiversity","Target_19","United Kingodm","Wales"],"keywords":["biotrophy","distribution","ecozones","grassland","mosses","soil","trophic ecology","waxcaps","woodland"],"pages":"773-792","year":"2013","abstract":"The genus Hygrocybe (Fr.)

Main conclusions Our analyses of R. melanophthalma s.l. collected from five continents supported the presence of six species-level lineages within this complex. Based on current sampling, two of these lineages were found to have broad intercontinental distributions, while the other four were limited to western North America. Of the six lineages, five were found on a single mountain in the western USA and the sixth occurred no more than 200 km away from this mountain. Our estimates of divergence times suggest that Pleistocene glacial cycles played an important role in species diversification within this group. At least three lineages show evidence of recent or ongoing population expansion.","uuid":"6610eea7-a571-3787-bfdd-2ebc3935d20f","authors":[{"forename":"Steven D.","surname":"Leavitt"},{"forename":"Fernando","surname":"Fern\u00e1ndez-Mendoza"},{"forename":"Sergio","surname":"P\u00e9rez-Ortega"},{"forename":"Mohammad","surname":"Sohrabi"},{"forename":"Pradeep K.","surname":"Divakar"},{"forename":"Jan","surname":"Vondr\u00e1k"},{"forename":"H.","surname":"Thorsten Lumbsch"},{"forename":"Larry L.

(northern red oak), a tree species having moderate shade tolerance, is failing to regenerate across its native range in North America, largely due to its inability to compete with shade-tolerant species. Throughout central Europe, where it was introduced in the 18th and 19th centuries, Q. rubra exhibits prolific regeneration even when growing with shade-tolerant trees under closed canopy conditions. A better understanding of factors that allow the proliferation of Q. rubra in its adventive range may provide insights into the conditions necessary to promote Q. rubra in North America. Our study investigated the regeneration dynamics of Q. rubra in six hardwood stands near Freiburg, Germany in relation to site conditions and the relative abundance and growth of indigenous tree species in forest understoreys. Despite high (94\u201398%) canopy closure at all stands, the density of Q. rubra regeneration (<2 m in height) was greater than that of all other tree species combined, averaging 24 stems m\u22121. Density of Q. rubra seedlings reached 125 stems m\u22122 directly below seed trees; however, the lack of seedlings beyond 15 m from a seed tree suggested limited seed dispersal. Seedlings were less abundant at relatively fertile sites with lowest densities corresponding most closely to elevated soil calcium. The abundance of Q. rubra was most highly variable in the midstorey (trees and shrubs >2.0 m in height and <10 cm diameter at breast height) with densities ranging from 200 to 1500 stems ha\u22121. Periodic selective harvesting at all stands, appears to maintain a disturbed state of mid-succession that allows Q. rubra seedlings to persist and recruit into the midstorey as canopy gaps become available. Clearly, stands of this non-indigenous species are successfully regenerating and the dominance of Q. rubra appears to be sustainable. Despite its benign performance in North America, Q. rubra can be an effective competitor under suitable conditions. Our findings deemphasize the importance of canopy closure on Q. rubra regeneration and suggest that in North America, preliminary cuts performed prior to shelterwood harvests should focus on midstorey removal of competitor species especially following oak mast years.","uuid":"87112e69-bb3d-3657-b977-ab2ee3c4d796","authors":[{"forename":"Kelly C.","surname":"Major"},{"forename":"Peter","surname":"Nosko"},{"forename":"Christian","surname":"Kuehne"},{"forename":"Daniel","surname":"Campbell"},{"forename":"J\u00fcrgen","surname":"Bauhus"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Forest Ecology and Management","firstAuthor":"Major"},{"id":"6016483454","title":"Phylogeny of Polycnemoideae (Amaranthaceae): Implications for biogeography, character evolution and taxonomy","type":"Journal Article","volume":"62","issue":"February","tags":["2013","Aichi_E","DE","GBIF_used","Germany","global_biodiversity","plants","Target_19"],"keywords":["Amaranthaceae","Hemichroa","molecular clock","Nitrophila","phylogeny","Polycnemoideae","Polycnemum","Surreya"],"pages":"100-111","year":"2013","abstract":"Polycnemoideae is a poorly studied subfamily of the Amaranthaceae\/Chenopodiaceae alliance which contains ca. 13 rare species in three disjunctly distributed genera.

We tested time, area of origin, habitat suitability, disjunction width and nature, and wind direction as possible range determinants. Location Global, but predominantly the Southern Hemisphere. Methods We mapped the range of the subfamily Danthonioideae, and used 39,000 locality records and an ensemble modelling approach to define areas with suitable danthonioid habitat. We used a well-sampled, dated phylogeny to estimate the number and direction of historical dispersal events, based on parsimony optimization. We tested for the impact of wind direction on dispersal rate using a likelihood approach, and for the effects of barrier width with a regression approach. Results We found 17 geographically isolated areas with suitable habitats for danthonioids. All currently suitable Southern Hemisphere areas have been occupied, but three apparently suitable areas in the Northern Hemisphere have not. We infer that southern Africa was first occupied in the Oligocene and that dispersal to the other areas was initiated in the middle Miocene. Inferred dispersal rate was correlated with the width of the disjunctions, up to a distance of 5000 km. There was no support for wind direction having influenced differences in dispersal rate. Main conclusions The current range of the Danthonioideae can be predicted ecologically (areas with suitable habitat) and historically (the width of the disjunctions separating the areas with suitable habitat and the area of origin). The direction of dispersal is dictated by the area of origin and by serendipity: there is no evidence for general patterns of dispersal, for example for dispersal occurring more frequently over land than over sea or in an easterly versus a westerly direction around the Southern Hemisphere. Thus the range and range-filling of Danthonioideae can be accounted for by surprisingly few variables: habitat suitability, distance between suitable areas, and area of origin.","uuid":"718a4137-923d-39a1-a042-918d3fec3d05","authors":[{"forename":"H.","surname":"Peter Linder"},{"forename":"Alexandre","surname":"Antonelli"},{"forename":"Aelys M.","surname":"Humphreys"},{"forename":"Michael D.","surname":"Pirie"},{"forename":"Rafael O.","surname":"W\u00fcest"}],"editors":[{"forename":"Richard","surname":"Ladle"}],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Peter Linder"},{"id":"6115952854","title":"Notes on the Chilean geographic distribution of several vascular plant species","type":"Journal Article","volume":"9","issue":"4","url":"http:\/\/www.checklist.org.br\/","tags":["2013","Aichi_E","Chile","Chile_biodiversity","CL","DE","GBIF_used","GBits_10","Germany","Target_19"],"keywords":[],"pages":"832-837","year":"2013","abstract":"New collections extend the Chilean geographic distributions of five native and one endemic vascular plant species: Coriaria ruscifolia L.

During the Quaternary, high- and mid-latitude species were extirpated from regions that were covered by ice or otherwise became unsuitable, persisting in refugial retreats where the environment was compatible with their tolerances. In this study we combine modern geographic range data, phylogeny, Pleistocene paleoclimatic models, and isotopic records of changes in global mean annual temperature, to produce a temporally continuous model of geographic changes in potential habitat for 59 species of North American turtles over the past 320 Ka (three full glacial-interglacial cycles). These paleophylogeographic models indicate the areas where past climates were compatible with the modern ranges of the species and serve as hypotheses for how their geographic ranges would have changed in response to Quaternary climate cycles. We test these hypotheses against physiological, genetic, taxonomic and fossil evidence, and we then use them to measure the effects of Quaternary climate cycles on species distributions. Patterns of range expansion, contraction, and fragmentation in the models are strongly congruent with (i) phylogeographic differentiation; (ii) morphological variation; (iii) physiological tolerances; and (iv) intraspecific genetic variability. Modern species with significant interspecific differentiation have geographic ranges that strongly fluctuated and repeatedly fragmented throughout the Quaternary. Modern species with low genetic diversity have geographic distributions that were highly variable and at times exceedingly small in the past. Our results reveal the potential for paleophylogeographic models to (i) reconstruct past geographic range modifications, (ii) identify geographic processes that result in genetic bottlenecks; and (iii) predict threats due to anthropogenic climate change in the future.","uuid":"204692a9-c9ef-3de9-bbd9-958ca245c890","authors":[{"forename":"Dennis","surname":"R\u00f6dder"},{"forename":"A.

In this study, we assessed the potential distribution of 23 estrildid finch species in order to analyse stability in recent and past diversity patterns and diversity centres in the Austral-Asiatic region. We used Maxent to predict recent distributions of each species and to project them onto the climatic conditions of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 21 000 yr BP) using two different scenarios (CCSM, MIROC).

Our results indicate a remarkably high stability of existing diversity centres. Although projections into the past show some differences in detail in the extent and exact position of the diversity centres, they reveal largely congruent large scale patterns in both time slices.

We first created spatially explicit probability distributions of its candidate reservoir species in Africa's Congo Basin. Reservoir species distributions were subsequently used to model current and projected future distributions of human monkeypox (MPX). Results indicate that forest clearing and climate are significant driving factors of the transmission of MPX from wildlife to humans under current climate conditions.

Future projections were made on IPCC 4th Assessment climate change scenarios for 2050 and 2080, ranging from more conservative to more aggressive, and representing the potential variation within which range shifts can be expected to occur. Future projections showed range shifts into regions where MPX has not been recorded previously. Increased suitability for MPX was predicted in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.

The two focal species differ radically in their phylogeographic structure, with R. temporaria being strongly variable among and within populations, and R. dalmatina homogeneous across Europe with a single strongly differentiated population in southern Italy. These differences were observed across the various markers studied, including microsatellites and SNP density, but especially in protein-coding nuclear genes where R. dalmatina had extremely low heterozygosity values across its range, including potential refugial areas, whereas R. temporaria had comparably high range-wide values, including many areas of probable postglacial colonization. A phylogeny of R. temporaria based on various concatenated mtDNA genes revealed that two haplotype clades endemic to Iberia form a paraphyletic group at the base of the cladogram, and all other haplotypes form a monophyletic group, in agreement with an Iberian origin of the species. Demographic analysis suggests that R. temporaria and R. dalmatina have genealogies of roughly the same time to coalescence (TMRCA \u223c3.5 mya for both species), but R. temporaria might have been been characterized by larger ancestral and current effective population sizes than R. dalmatina.

The 5 aim of this work was to achieve a description of VOC emissions from poorly described tropical vegetation to be compared with the quite well investigated and highly heterogeneous emissions from Mediterranean vegetation. For this task, common plant species of both ecosystems were investigated. Sixteen plant species from the Mediterranean area, which is known for its special diversity in VOC emitting 10 plant species, were chosen. In contrast, little information is currently available regarding emissions of VOCs from tropical tree species at the leaf level. Twelve plant species from different environments of the Amazon basin, i.e. Terra firme, V\u00b4arzea and Igap\u00b4 o, were screened for emission of VOCs at leaf level with a branch enclosure system. Analysis of the volatile organics was performed online by a proton-transfer-reaction 15 mass spectrometer (PTR-MS) and offline by collection on adsorbent tubes and subsequent gas chromatographic analysis. Isoprene was quantitatively the most dominant compound emitted followed by monoterpenes, methanol and acetone. Most of the Mediterranean species emitted a variety of monoterpenes, whereas only five tropical species were monoterpene emitters exhibiting a quite conservative emission pattern 20 ( -pinene>limonene>sabinene> -pinene). Mediterranean plants showed additional emissions of sesquiterpenes, whereas in the case of plants from the Amazon region no sesquiterpenes were detected probably due to a lack of sensitivity in the measuring systems. On the other hand methanol emissions, an indicator of growth, were common in most of the tropical and Mediterranean species. A few species from both ecosys25 tems showed acetone emissions. The observed heterogeneous emissions including reactive VOC species which are not easily detected by flux measurements, give reason to perform more screening at leaf level and, whenever possible, within the forests under ambient conditions.","uuid":"31dd3375-23ef-3586-9515-531534ce1532","authors":[{"forename":"A.","surname":"Bracho-Nunez"},{"forename":"N.

Within problem formulation, the insecticidal trait, the crop, the receiving environment, and protection goals were characterized, and a conceptual model was developed to identify routes through which aquatic organisms may be exposed to insecticidal proteins in maize tissue. Following a tiered approach for exposure assessment, worst-case exposures were estimated using standardized models, and factors mitigating exposure were described. Based on exposure estimates, shredders were identified as the functional group most likely to be exposed to insecticidal proteins. However, even using worst-case assumptions, the exposure of shredders to Bt maize was low and studies supporting the current risk assessments were deemed adequate. Determining if early tier toxicity studies are necessary to inform the risk assessment for a specific GM crop should be done on a case by case basis, and should be guided by thorough problem formulation and exposure assessment. The processes used to develop the Bt maize case study are intended to serve as a model for performing risk assessments on future traits and crops.","uuid":"e35486bb-9372-3f20-8e6f-cc24005e31e4","authors":[{"forename":"Keri","surname":"Carstens"},{"forename":"Jennifer","surname":"Anderson"},{"forename":"Pamela","surname":"Bachman"},{"forename":"Adinda","surname":"De Schrijver"},{"forename":"Galen","surname":"Dively"},{"forename":"Brian","surname":"Federici"},{"forename":"Mick","surname":"Hamer"},{"forename":"Marco","surname":"Gielkens"},{"forename":"Peter","surname":"Jensen"},{"forename":"William","surname":"Lamp"},{"forename":"Stefan","surname":"Rauschen"},{"forename":"Geoff","surname":"Ridley"},{"forename":"J\u00f6rg","surname":"Romeis"},{"forename":"Annabel","surname":"Waggoner"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Transgenic Research","firstAuthor":"Carstens"},{"id":"6016482094","title":"Effects of Late-Cenozoic Glaciation on Habitat Availability in Antarctic Benthic Shrimps (Crustacea: Decapoda: Caridea).","type":"Journal Article","volume":"7","issue":"9","url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23029463","tags":["2012","Aichi_E","Antarctic_biodiversity","DE","GB","GBIF_used","Germany","marine","New Zealand","NZ","Target_19"],"keywords":[],"pages":"e46283","year":"2012","abstract":"Marine invertebrates inhabiting the high Antarctic continental shelves are challenged by disturbance of the seafloor by grounded ice, low but stable water temperatures and variable food availability in response to seasonal sea-ice cover.

Using an ensemble of bioclimatic envelope models (BEMs), we modelled the climatic suitability of 191 stream macroinvertebrate species from 12 orders across Europe under two climate change scenarios for 2080 on a spatial resolution of 5 arc minutes. Analyses included assessments of relative changes in species\u2019 climatically suitable areas as well as their potential shifts in latitude and longitude with respect to species\u2019 thermal preferences. Climate-change effects were also analysed regarding species\u2019 ecological and biological groupings, namely 1) endemicity and 2) rarity within European ecoregions, 3) life cycle, 4) stream zonation preference and 5) current preference. The BEMs projected that suitable climate conditions would persist in Europe in the year 2080 for nearly 99% of the modelled species regardless of the climate scenario. Nevertheless, a decrease in the amount of climatically suitable areas was projected for 57-59% of the species. Depending on the scenario, losses could be of 38-44% on average. The suitable areas for species were projected to shift, on average, 4.7-6.6\u00b0 north and 3.9-5.4\u00b0 east. Cold-adapted species were projected to lose climatically suitable areas, while gains were expected for warm-adapted species. When projections were analysed for different species groupings, only endemics stood out as a particular group. That is, endemics were projected to lose significantly larger amounts of suitable climatic areas than non-endemic species. Despite the uncertainties involved in modelling exercises such as this, the extent of projected distributional changes reveals further the vulnerability of freshwater organisms to climate change and implies a need to understand the consequences for ecological function and biodiversity conservation.","uuid":"fd4fad1c-fac2-3096-98eb-1f2f8836d864","authors":[{"forename":"Sami","surname":"Domisch"},{"forename":"Miguel Bastos","surname":"Ara\u00fajo"},{"forename":"N\u00faria","surname":"Bonada"},{"forename":"Steffen U.","surname":"Pauls"},{"forename":"Sonja C.","surname":"J\u00e4hnig"},{"forename":"Peter","surname":"Haase"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Domisch"},{"id":"6016483484","title":"Continental-scale variability in browser diversity is a major driver of diversity patterns in acacias across Africa","type":"Journal Article","volume":"100","url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1365-2745.2012.01994.x\/abstract","tags":["2012","Africa_biodiversity","Aichi_E","BE","Belgium","BR","Brazil","DE","Denmark","DK","GB","GBIF_used","Germany","Netherlands","niche_modeling","NL","plants","SDM","Target_19"],"keywords":["diversity patterns","herbivory","plant\u2013herbivore interactions","Quaternary climate change","resource\u2013consumer relationships","savanna species","speciation"],"pages":"1093-1104","year":"2012","abstract":"1. It has been proposed that, across broad spatial scales, climatic factors are the main drivers of ecological patterns, while biotic factors are mainly important at local spatial scales. However, few tests of the effect of biotic interactions on broad-scale patterns have been conducted; conclusions about the scale-dependence of the importance of biotic interactions thus seem premature. 2. We developed an extensive database of locality records of one of Africa\u2019s most conspicuous groups, the acacias (the genera Senegalia and Vachellia), and used species distribution models (SDMs) to estimate the distribution of all African acacias. 3. African acacias are particularly well adapted against mammalian herbivory; therefore, we hypothesized that browser diversity could be an important driver of acacia richness. Species richness maps for the two genera were created from SDM-generated maps. Ordinary least square (OLS) regressions and, to consider spatial autocorrelation, simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) analyses were used to model richness of the two genera in relation to mammalian browser richness, current environment (including climate), and climate history since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). We used variation partitioning to determine what percentage of variation could be explained by these three groups of factors. 4. Both genera showed centres of richness in East Africa and the Limpopo Basin of southern Africa. Browser richness was the best explanatory variable for richness of both genera. Environmental factors explained negligible variation in the richness of Senegalia, but some variation in Vachellia. For both genera, the residuals of the species richness model of one genus also explained much variation in the richness of the other genus, indicating that common factors not considered in the richness analyses here may additionally be driving the richness of both genera. 5. Mechanisms that could generate a correlation between browser and acacia richness are proposed, and differences in the determinants of richness patterns of Senegalia and Vachellia discussed in the light of the two genera\u2019s history of colonization of Africa. 6. Synthesis. This is the first study that demonstrates that consumer diversity can influence richness patterns at continental scales and demonstrates that biotic factors can drive richness even at broad spatial scales.","uuid":"228da240-ac7d-38e1-a818-59d79b3555c5","authors":[{"forename":"Michelle","surname":"Greve"},{"forename":"Anne Mette","surname":"Lykke"},{"forename":"Christopher W.","surname":"Fagg"},{"forename":"Jan","surname":"Bogaert"},{"forename":"Ib","surname":"Friis"},{"forename":"Rob","surname":"Marchant"},{"forename":"Andrew R.","surname":"Marshall"},{"forename":"Brody S.","surname":"Sandel"},{"forename":"Christopher","surname":"Sandom"},{"forename":"Marco","surname":"Schmidt"},{"forename":"Jonathan R.","surname":"Timberlake"},{"forename":"Jan J.","surname":"Wieringa"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Greve"},{"id":"6016484364","title":"Efficient rescue of threatened biodiversity data using reBiND workflows","type":"Journal Article","volume":"146","issue":"4","url":"http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/11263504.2012.740086","tags":["2012","Aichi_E","DE","GBIF_acknowledged","GBIF_used","Germany","Global_biodiversity","informatics","Target_19"],"keywords":["ABCD","BioCASE","Biodiversity","data rescue workflow","reBiND","research data"],"pages":"752-755","year":"2012","abstract":"Biodiversity data generated in the context of research projects often lack a strategy for long-term preservation and availability, and are therefore at risk of becoming outdated and finally lost.

Currently, half of the world's freshwater turtles and tortoises are considered threatened with extinction, and climate change may exacerbate these declines.

We use species distribution models developed under current climate conditions for 78% of all extant species and project them onto different Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenarios for 2080. We detect a strong dependence of temperature shaping most species ranges, which coincide with their general temperature-related physiological traits (i.e., temperature-dependent sex determination). Furthermore, the extent and distribution of the current bioclimatic niches of most chelonians may change remarkably in the near future, likely leading to a substantial decrease of local species abundance and ultimately a reduction in species richness. Future climatic changes may cause the ranges of 86% of the species to contract, and of these ranges, nearly 12% are predicted to be situated completely outside their currently realized niches. Hence, the interplay of increasing habitat fragmentation and loss due to climatic stress may result in a serious threat for several chelonian species.","uuid":"38bc0b8a-cc7f-3986-b544-72266d2c9672","authors":[{"forename":"Flora","surname":"Ihlow"},{"forename":"Johannes","surname":"Dambach"},{"forename":"Jan O.","surname":"Engler"},{"forename":"Morris","surname":"Flecks"},{"forename":"Timo","surname":"Hartmann"},{"forename":"Sven","surname":"Nekum"},{"forename":"Hossein","surname":"Rajaei"},{"forename":"Dennis","surname":"R\u00f6dder"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Ihlow"},{"id":"6016484304","title":"First record of the warty oreo, Allocyttus verrucosus (Gilchrist, 1906), in Greenland waters","type":"Journal Article","volume":"online","url":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/jai.12024","tags":["2012","Aichi_E","DE","GBIF_used","Germany","global_biodiversity","Target_19"],"keywords":[],"year":"2012","abstract":"Fishes of the zeiform family Oreosomatidae, containing 10 valid species in four genera, chiefly occur in the deeper (500\u2013 1000 m) temperate slope waters of the southern hemisphere.

The effects of land use on the diversity of range-restricted species have rarely been studied and remain unknown for vascular epiphytes \u2013 diverse and important elements of tropical forests. This study analyses the vulnerability of range-restricted epiphyte species to human land use, compared to that of widespread species. Location Western Ecuador (Choc\u00f3 ecoregion): lowland rain forest (Bilsa, 0\u00b021\u2032 N 79\u00b044\u2032 W, 450\u2013650 m a.s.l.) and Andean cloud forest (Otonga, 0\u00b025\u2032 S 79\u00b001\u2032 W, 1650\u20132250 m a.s.l.). Methods The epiphytic vegetation of 220 study plots was surveyed. Distribution data based on herbarium specimens were compiled for all identified species in order to estimate their geographical and elevational ranges as well as the climatic conditions within the species' ranges. These range characteristics were compared for species found in contiguous primary forests, primary forest fragments, secondary forests, and for isolated remnant trees in pastures. Results Of the 587 identified epiphyte species, 252 were endemic to the Choc\u00f3 ecoregion (42.9%). Choc\u00f3 endemics were not more strongly affected by human land use than non-endemics. However, small geographical ranges and narrow climatic niches were associated with higher vulnerability to habitat changes caused by land use. Epiphyte assemblages in young secondary forests had the lowest proportions of range-restricted species and were dominated by species with broad elevational ranges. Species in secondary forests occupied the broadest ranges of mean annual temperature and precipitation; species on isolated remnant trees at the lowland site inhabited on average warmer and drier geographical ranges than species in the primary forest. Main conclusions Epiphyte species with restricted geographical distributions and narrow climatic tolerances are particularly vulnerable to human-induced habitat changes, but endemism to national or biogeographical entities alone is a poor indicator of vulnerability. Instead, narrower ecological niches correlate with lower plasticity towards changes in microclimatic habitat conditions. Besides a higher extinction risk due to their small range sizes, many range-restricted species might be threatened by their lower tolerance to the impacts of human land use.","uuid":"cc0ef12b-8cd7-3899-95ec-1019813ef012","authors":[{"forename":"Nils","surname":"K\u00f6ster"},{"forename":"Holger","surname":"Kreft"},{"forename":"J\u00fcrgen","surname":"Nieder"},{"forename":"Wilhelm","surname":"Barthlott"}],"editors":[{"forename":"Walter","surname":"Jetz"}],"publication_outlet":"Journal of Biogeography","firstAuthor":"K\u00f6ster"},{"id":"6016482244","title":"Biological Flora of the British Isles: Rosa spinosissima L.","type":"Journal Article","volume":"100","issue":"2","url":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/j.1365-2745.2011.01950.x","tags":["2012","DE","GBIF_used","GB_biodiversity","Germany","species distribution","university"],"keywords":["climatic limitation","communities","conservation","ecophysiology","geographical and altitudinal distribution","germination","herbivory","parasites and diseases","reproductive biology","soils"],"pages":"561-576","year":"2012","abstract":"1. This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Rosa spinosissima L. (R. pimpinellifolia L.) that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behav- iour.

Rosa spinosissima is a small, deciduous shrub forming clonal patches fromroot suckers. In Brit- ain it is common on stabilized coastal dunes, more or less base-rich heaths, and on open, dry habi- tats on chalk or limestone inland. It is naturally distributed across temperate Europe and western and central Asia. 3. The small leaves and leaflets, in combination with many straight or slightly curved bristles and prickles, and the black hips, make R. spinosissima easily recognizable in Britain. It normally does not exceed 10\u201340 cmbut cultivars often growtaller. 4. The seeds are dispersed by birds and other animals, particularly as the hips are a favoured diet of birds, because of the high vitamin and anthocyanin content. Vegetative spread is frequent through the root suckers. 5. Cultivars are commonly planted for amenity and in gardens. The origin of the cultivars is not known, but genetic exchange of these with natural British populations may lead to introgression with genotypes which are not locally adapted. The invasive Rosa rugosa may be a threat in some coastal habitats as this species is displacing R. spinosissimaon the GermanNorth Sea coast.","uuid":"fe164fd1-99bc-303a-b57c-54be686b7e07","authors":[{"forename":"Eike","surname":"Mayland-Quellhorst"},{"forename":"Jens","surname":"F\u00f6ller"},{"forename":"Volker","surname":"Wissemann"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Mayland-Quellhorst"},{"id":"6016483994","title":"Mining the Himalayan Uplands Plant Database for a Conservation Baseline Using the Public GMBA Webportal","type":"Book Section","url":"http:\/\/www.springerlink.com\/index\/10.1007\/978-4-431-54006-9","tags":["2012","Aichi_E","CH","DE","GBIF_used","Germany","Himalayas_biodiversity","Switzerland","Target_19","US"],"keywords":[],"pages":"135-158","year":"2012","publisher":"Springer Japan","abstract":"This chapter shows how a synthesis of heterogeneous biological field observation data, robust taxonomic methods, and data mining leads to up-to-date scientific information that is important for sustainability and conservation management. The core of this type of research is a database with field observations. Here we use the Himalayan Uplands Plant Database (HUP), which consists of extensive collections of botanic survey information collected by the senior author in the Himalayas and in renowned public herbaria over more than 25 years. The HUP database is primarily based on preserved herbarium specimens and presently holds more than 164,000 occurrence records of vascular plants. It contains the records of more than 2,000 collectors and observers who had either directly or indirectly contributed, or records that were derived from herbarium label information. Consistent taxonomic information and the sound use of taxonomy is the key to success of any exercise with large amounts of heterogeneous biological collection data. Taxonomy, especially on the scales of developing consistent cross-border registries, still comprises one of the most obvious bottlenecks to our understanding of biodiversity. In the absence of consistent backbone taxonomies, physical documentation (collecting, preserving, and curating of good and representative herbarium specimens or other vouchers), and quality control must be stressed as necessary preconditions to vegetation and ecology-related studies. Although inherent synonymy rates are obviously quite variable among different taxonomic groups, there is no logical, automated, or permanent procedure that could identify or constrain synonyms. A wide range of Floras, monographs, taxonomic treatments, original publications, and databases has been consulted in HUP to identify and verify specimens, and to develop, at least internally, consistent taxonomies. Other challenges of using such a large collection are the long time span covered and the diversity and inconsistency of spatial and altitudinal information. Thus, large parts of the data are currently not covered by current georeferencing databases such as BioGeomancer or by international taxonomic databases such as ITIS (Integrated Taxonomic Information System). The history of modern biodiversity exploration is brief\u2014in the Himalayas, a mere 200 years\u2014whereas dramatic ecological change and disturbance including deforestation, land degradation, melting glaciers, and increasing severity of natural hazards occurred during the periods of collection. Historic data are thus precious not only on account of the \u201cpriority principle\u201d in biological taxonomy. To ensure the highest level of usage of such precious data, we regard the availability of the data for similar and potentially even larger exercises as critically important. Here we show that a new culture needs to develop and mature for sharing, exploiting, and improving primary biodiversity data and for taxonomic work in progress. The example of HUP is used to give a step-by-step best practice guidance to make biological data digitally available online using existing and rapidly developing data-sharing infrastructures. The information of the database columns was transferred into the Darwin Core 2 format and uploaded to the publicly accessible Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF; www.gbif.org). Through GBIF it is also available using the Mountain Biodiversity Portal (MBP; www.mountain biodiversity.org), which allows to query, filter, and download GBIF data specific for mountain areas, with a horizontal (region) and vertical (elevation, climate) dimension and includes many options. In addition, a first-version XML-metadata information was created and uploaded to the National Biological Information Infrastructure (NBII) metadata clearinghouse (National Biological Information Infrastructure 2010; http:\/\/metadata.nbii.gov\/clearinghouse). Thus, the HUP data are made accessible worldwide either by searching for metadata in the NBII clearinghouse database and through the authors, by searching for original biological data at GBIF, or by searching for mountain-specific information at the Global Mountain Biodiversity Assessment (GMBA) mountain biodiversity portal.","chapter":"Chapter 6","city":"Tokyo","uuid":"e6491155-f252-31a1-bbb4-51442fe9a883","authors":[{"forename":"Dirk","surname":"Nemitz"},{"forename":"Falk","surname":"Huettmann"},{"forename":"Eva M.","surname":"Spehn"},{"forename":"Wolf Bernhard","surname":"Dickor\u00e9"}],"editors":[{"forename":"Falk","surname":"Huettmann"}],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Nemitz"},{"id":"6016484574","title":"Geographic distribution, colour variation and molecular diversity of miniature frogs of the Eleutherodactylus limbatus group from Cuba","type":"Journal Article","volume":"48","issue":"2","url":"http:\/\/www.mvences.de\/p\/p1\/Vences_A238.pdf","tags":["2012","Aichi_E","amphibians","CU","Cuba","Cuba_biodiversity","DE","GBIF_used","Germany","species distribution","Target_19","Taxonomy","university"],"keywords":["amphibia","anura","colour evolution","cytochrome b","e","E. iberia","E. jaumei","E. limbatus","E. orientalis","eleutherodactylidae","eleutherodactylus cubanus","geographic distribution","iberia","jaumei","limbatus","molecular phylogeny","orientalis","taxonomy","taxonomy.","terrarana"],"pages":"71-91","year":"2012","abstract":"The endemic Cuban Eleutherodactylus limbatus group contains five species of miniature species of frogs (E. cubanus, E. iberia, E. jaumei, E. limbatus, E. orientalis), and one larger and more generalized species (E. etheridgei). Several of the miniature species have contrasting colour patterns with bright yellow or white stripes on a dark dorsum, and two of these species are known to sequester skin alkaloids. Based on a review of literature, museum data and numerous own, unpublished field records we provide an updated list of georeferenced locality records of all species of the group that confirms their strict allopatric distribution pattern despite the close geographic proximity of some species. A phylogenetic tree based on newly analysed partial DNA sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (566 bp) placed the dull-coloured species E. etheridgei and E. cubanus in a basal position, followed by a well-differentiated E. orientalis, and a highly supported but poorly differentiated clade containing E. iberia, E. jaumei and E. limbatus. In addition to these three forms, this clade also included various subclades with a similar degree of differentiation, which rendered paraphyletic the formally described species, indicating the need for a taxonomic revision. The evolution of contrasting dorsal colour patterns (dorsolateral stripes on a dark brown, light brown or yellow dorsum) apparently was characterized by homoplasy. The highest diversity of this group is concentrated in small areas in the eastern mountains, and the population of E. limbatus sampled from western Cuba was genetically similar to an eastern Cuban population, suggesting that only one relatively shallow evolutionary lineage might have succeeded in expanding its range into the west of the island.","uuid":"3b5e39f4-970f-3312-82d2-77baf08a7c68","authors":[{"forename":"Ariel","surname":"Rodr\u00edguez"},{"forename":"Roberto","surname":"Alonso"},{"forename":"Jos\u00e9 Antonio","surname":"Rodr\u00edguez"},{"forename":"Miguel","surname":"Vences"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Salamandra","firstAuthor":"Rodr\u00edguez"},{"id":"6016481344","title":"Revisiting the \u201cRalum Project\u201d: Molluscs collected by Friedrich Dahl in 1896-1897 for the Museum of Natural History Berlin","type":"Journal Article","volume":"88","issue":"1","url":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1002\/zoos.201200009","tags":["2012","DE","GBIF_used","Germany","museum","New Guinea_biodiversity"],"keywords":["Anton Dohrn","Bismarck Archipelago","colonialism","contextualisation","Karl August M\u00f6bius","museum collections"],"pages":"79-95","year":"2012","abstract":"While the scientific significance of museum collections has gained increasing attention in recent years, their historical contextualisation has often been neglected.

Here, we present an account on Friedrich Dahl's research expedition to Ralum (German New Guinea) in the years 1896 to 1897 from which originate many important specimens in the natural history museum in Berlin. Dahl collected several hundreds of specimens of molluscs, birds, and reptiles and thus greatly extended the representation of the tropical fauna within the museum collection. However, in contrast to other departments, Dahl's contribution to the malacological collection has only been inventorized fragmentarily. We here identify those molluscs from Ralum that have been neglected so far and thus determine the complete amount of Dahl's malacological alcohol collection. Moreover, we outline the circumstances of this expedition and the further utilization of his specimens in subsequent museum's research. We thus integrate the Ralum project into its historical context that reveals not only its relevance for scientists and science in the past but also its significance for the present-day museum in Berlin.","uuid":"0f604969-c278-3def-a8cc-166690b7967c","authors":[{"forename":"Elisa Maria","surname":"Schmitt"},{"forename":"Matthias","surname":"Glaubrecht"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Zoosystematics and Evolution","firstAuthor":"Schmitt"},{"id":"6016483794","title":"Spatial distribution and ecological variation of re-discovered German truffle habitats","type":"Journal Article","volume":"online","url":"http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1754504812000268","tags":["2012","CH","DE","ecology","GBIF_used","Germany","Germany_biodiversity","in_press","IUCN Red List","Switzerland","university"],"keywords":["Climate change","Cultivation potential","Host vegetation","Site characteristics","Spatial distribution","Truffle habitat","Tuber aestivum"],"year":"2012","abstract":"Several truffle species (Tuber spp.) are highly prized by chefs and gourmets with some commanding prices of up to \u20ac9.000 kg\u22121 on international markets.

High values of Picea pollen and the presence of Larix pollen in sediments dated to 50\u201340 ka BP strongly suggest the presence of forest or woodland early in MIS 3; the trees grew within a vegetation matrix dominated by grass and sedge, and there is indirect evidence of grazing animals. Thus the interstadial ecosystem was different in structure and composition from the Holocene or from the preceding Last Interglacial period. An early Holocene warm period is indicated by renewed thermokarst lake formation and a range of fossil taxa. Multiple extralimital plant taxa suggest mean July temperatures above modern values. The local presence of spruce during the early Holocene warm interval is evident from a radiocarbon-dated spruce macrofossil remain and indicates significant range extension far beyond the modern tree line. The first direct evidence of spruce in Northwest Alaska during the early Holocene has implications for the presence of forest refugia in Central Beringia and previously assumed routes and timing of post-glacial forest expansion in Alaska.","uuid":"a7893028-b4b9-3148-90b0-21bda881962a","authors":[{"forename":"Sebastian","surname":"Wetterich"},{"forename":"Guido","surname":"Grosse"},{"forename":"Lutz","surname":"Schirrmeister"},{"forename":"Andrei A.","surname":"Andreev"},{"forename":"Anatoly A.","surname":"Bobrov"},{"forename":"Frank","surname":"Kienast"},{"forename":"Nancy H.","surname":"Bigelow"},{"forename":"Mary E.","surname":"Edwards"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Wetterich"},{"id":"6016478754","title":"Applications and future challenges in marine species distribution modeling","type":"Journal Article","volume":"21","issue":"1","url":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/aqc.1160","tags":["2011","climate","DE","GBIF_used","Germany","marine","niche_modeling","SDM"],"keywords":["glacial","great white shark","marine biodiversity","spatially explicit models"],"pages":"92-100","year":"2011","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","abstract":"1.Anthropogenic climate change affects both phenology and distribution patterns of the world's biota including marine species.

Thermophilic species became extinct in the North and survived in southern retreats, e.g. the Mediterranean Basin. These repeated extinction and (re)colonisation events led to long-term isolation and intermixing of populations and thus resulted in strong genetic imprints in many European species therefore being composed of several genetic lineages. To better understand these cycles of repeated expansion and retraction, we selected the Marbled White butterfly Melanargia galathea. Fourty-one populations scattered over Europe and the Maghreb and one population of the sibling taxon M. lachesis were analysed using allozyme electrophoresis. RESULTS: We obtained seven distinct lineages applying neighbour joining and STRUCTURE analyses: (i) Morocco, (ii) Tunisia, (iii) Sicily, (iv) Italy and southern France, (v) eastern Balkans extending to Central Europe, (vi) western Balkans with western Carpathian Basin as well as (vii) south-western Alps. The hierarchy of these splits is well matching the chronology of glacial and interglacial cycles since the Gunz ice age starting with an initial split between the galathea group in North Africa and the lachesis group in Iberia. These genetic structures were compared with past distribution patterns during the last glacial stage calculated with distribution models. CONCLUSIONS: Both methods suggest climatically suitable areas in the Maghreb and the southern European peninsulas with distinct refugia during the last glacial period and underpin strong range expansions to the North during the Postglacial. However, the allozyme patterns reveal biogeographical structures not detected by distribution modelling as two distinct refugia in the Maghreb, two or more distinct refugia at the Balkans and a close link between the eastern Maghreb and Sicily. Furthermore, the genetically highly diverse western Maghreb might have acted as source or speciation centre of this taxon, while the eastern, genetically impoverished Maghreb population might result from a relatively recent recolonisation from Europe via Sicily.","uuid":"246b5045-80ab-37c8-9413-b8e935692b0e","authors":[{"forename":"Jan Christian","surname":"Habel"},{"forename":"Luc","surname":"Lens"},{"forename":"Dennis","surname":"R\u00f6dder"},{"forename":"Thomas","surname":"Schmitt"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"BMC evolutionary biology","firstAuthor":"Habel"},{"id":"6016479924","title":"Landscape genetics of a recent population extirpation in a burnet moth species","type":"Journal Article","url":"http:\/\/www.springerlink.com\/index\/10.1007\/s10592-011-0280-3","tags":["2011","conservation","DE","GBIF_used","Germany","LU","Luxembourg","museum","niche_modeling","SDM","university"],"keywords":["Allozyme electrophoresis","Habitat fragmentation","Land-use change","Population bottleneck","Species Distribution Modelling","Zygaena loti"],"year":"2011","abstract":"The intensification of agricultural land use over wide parts of Europe has led to the decline of semi-natural habitats, such as extensively used meadows, with those that remain often being small and isolated. These rapid changes in land use during recent decades have strongly affected populations inhabiting these ecosystems. Increasing habitat deterioration and declining permeability of the surrounding landscape matrix disrupt the gene flow within metapopulations. The burnet moth species Zygaena loti has suffered strongly from recent habitat fragmentation, as reflected by its declining abundance. We have studied its population genetic structure and found a high level of genetic diversity in some of the populations analysed, while others display low genetic diversity and a lack of heterozygosity. Zygaena loti was formerly highly abundant in meadows and along the skirts of forests. However, the species is currently restricted to isolated habitat remnants, which is reflected by the high genetic divergence among populations (F ST: 0.136). Species distribution modelling as well as the spatial examination of panmictic clusters within the study area strongly support a scattered population structure for this species. We suggest that populations with a high level of genetic diversity still represent the former genetic structure of interconnected populations, while populations with low numbers of alleles, high F IS values, and a lack of heterozygosity display the negative effects of reduced interconnectivity. A continuous exchange of individuals is necessary to maintain high genetic variability.

These communities\u2019 environmental observations represent a wealth of information which is currently hardly used or used only in isolation and therefore in need of integration with other information sources. Indeed, this very integration will lead to a paradigm shift from a mere Sensor Web to an Observation Web with semantically enriched content emanating from sensors, environmental simulations and citizens. The paper also describes the research challenges to realize the Observation Web and the associated environmental enablers for the Future Internet. Such an environmental enabler could for instance be an electronic sensing device, a web-service application, or even a social networking group affording or facilitating the capability of the Future Internet applications to consume, produce, and use environmental observations in cross-domain applications. The term \u2015envirofied\u2016 Future Internet is coined to describe this overall target that forms a cornerstone of work in the Environmental Usage Area within the Future Internet PPP program. Relevant trends described in the paper are the usage of ubiquitous sensors (anywhere), the provision and generation of information by citizens, and the convergence of real and virtual realities to convey understanding of environmental observations. The paper addresses the technical challenges in the Environmental Usage Area and the need for designing multi-style service oriented architecture. Key topics are the mapping of requirements to capabilities, providing scalability and robustness with implementing context aware information retrieval. Another essential research topic is handling data fusion and model based computation, and the related propagation of information uncertainty. Approaches to security, standardization and harmonization, all essential for sustainable solutions, are summarized from the perspective of the Environmental Usage Area. The paper concludes with an overview of emerging, high impact applications in the environmental areas concerning land ecosystems (biodiversity), air quality (atmospheric conditions) and water ecosystems (marine asset management).","uuid":"7add5e71-bdbc-3824-ab74-998a2414de84","authors":[{"forename":"Denis","surname":"Havlik"},{"forename":"Sven","surname":"Schade"},{"forename":"Zoheir A.","surname":"Sabeur"},{"forename":"Paolo","surname":"Mazzetti"},{"forename":"Kym","surname":"Watson"},{"forename":"Arne J.","surname":"Berre"},{"forename":"Jose Lorenzo","surname":"Mon"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Havlik"},{"id":"6016480414","title":"Some Like It Hot: The Influence and Implications of Climate Change on Coffee Berry Borer (Hypothenemus hampei) and Coffee Production in East Africa","type":"Journal Article","volume":"6","issue":"9","url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0024528","tags":["2011","agriculture","climate","DE","GB","GBIF_used","Germany","KE","Kenya","university","US","USDA"],"keywords":[],"pages":"e24528","year":"2011","abstract":"The negative effects of climate change are already evident for many of the 25 million coffee farmers across the tropics and the 90 billion dollar (US) coffee industry.

In order to anticipate threats and prioritize management actions for H. hampei we present here, maps on future distributions of H. hampei in coffee producing areas of East Africa. Using the CLIMEX model we relate present-day insect distributions to current climate and then project the fitted climatic envelopes under future scenarios A2A and B2B (for HADCM3 model). In both scenarios, the situation with H. hampei is forecasted to worsen in the current Coffea arabica producing areas of Ethiopia, the Ugandan part of the Lake Victoria and Mt. Elgon regions, Mt. Kenya and the Kenyan side of Mt. Elgon, and most of Rwanda and Burundi. The calculated hypothetical number of generations per year of H. hampei is predicted to increase in all C. arabica-producing areas from five to ten. These outcomes will have serious implications for C. arabica production and livelihoods in East Africa. We suggest that the best way to adapt to a rise of temperatures in coffee plantations could be via the introduction of shade trees in sun grown plantations.

Although various metrics have been proposed for this task, no comparisons of their performance are available yet that express the linearity of range shifts and error-proneness. Herein, we assess the performance of six niche overlap metrics using three sister pairs of plethodontid salamanders as well as artificial species to test for linearity of overlap curves, impacts of varying potential distribution sizes and study area sizes. Location North America, artificial environments. Methods Species distribution models for the salamanders were performed with Maxent, and artificial species were created in the R environment. Potential distributions of species with varying range sizes and extents of the study area were compared using the Bray\u2013Curtis distance BC, Schoener's D, two different modifications of the Hellinger distance Imod, Icor, Pianka's O and Horn's R. Niche overlaps in ecological space were compared using linear discriminant analyses based on principal components. Results Simulations of niche overlaps revealed strong variations in the performance of the niche overlap metrics. In artificial species, BC and D performed best, followed by O, R and Icor, but the modified Hellinger distance Imod showed a nonlinear slope and a truncated range. Furthermore, the simulations suggest that, in proportionally small potential distributions on large grids, an inclusion of a high proportion of grid cells with low occurrence probabilities representing background noise may bias assessments of niche overlaps. Main conclusions Both the salamander examples and simulations suggest that Schoener's D and the Bray\u2013Curtis distance BC are best suited to compute niche overlaps from potential distributions derived from species distribution models. However, like all analysed metrics, both D and BC are seriously affected by the inclusion of high numbers of grid cells where the species are probably absent, i.e. with low occurrence probabilities. Therefore, pre-processing to eliminate background noise in the potential distribution grids is highly recommended.","uuid":"533b58e5-2f56-364d-a513-b1ae9b8514a0","authors":[{"forename":"Dennis","surname":"R\u00f6dder"},{"forename":"Jan O.","surname":"Engler"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Global Ecology and Biogeography","firstAuthor":"R\u00f6dder"},{"id":"6016478834","title":"Low mountain ranges: summit traps for montane freshwater species under climate change","type":"Journal Article","volume":"20","issue":"13","url":"http:\/\/www.springerlink.com\/index\/10.1007\/s10531-011-0140-y","tags":["2011","climate","conservation","DE","GBIF_used","Germany","museum"],"keywords":["BIOMOD","Climate change","Low mountain ranges","Montane aquatic insects","Species distribution models"],"pages":"3133-3146","year":"2011","abstract":"Global climate change (GCC) is expected to lead to massive loss of global biodiversity in the alpine regions of mountain ranges.

We chose a species distribution modeling approach to assess potential GCC impacts on the future distributions of montane freshwater invertebrates under two different greenhouse gas scenarios and three averaged general circulation models. For this, ensemble models consisting of six algorithms [generalized linear model (GLM), generalized boosted model (GBM), generalized additive model (GAM), classification tree analysis (CTA), artificial neural networks (ANN), and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS)] were applied to project areas of 23 cold-stenothermic aquatic insects from montane regions of Central Europe.

Species distribution ranges below 1000 m above sea level were found to decrease by up to ~96% according to the severest greenhouse gas emission scenario. While the Alps remain the single main refugium under the A2a greenhouse gas emission scenario, the more moderate climate scenario B2a shows fragmented potential persistence of montane insects in some low mountain ranges. The results show that montane freshwater assemblages in low mountain ranges are particularly threatened by ongoing GCC. As vertical dispersal is limited by elevational restriction, low mountain ranges may act as summit traps under GCC. We thus propose that GCC will lead to the extinction of several species and unique genetic lineages of postglacial relict species, resulting in a significant decline in Central European fauna.","uuid":"9a010f79-cedf-36bb-a3fd-7d80e541405c","authors":[{"forename":"Jan","surname":"Sauer"},{"forename":"Sami","surname":"Domisch"},{"forename":"Carsten","surname":"Nowak"},{"forename":"Peter","surname":"Haase"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Sauer"},{"id":"6016479264","title":"Long-term population dynamics of Dactylorhiza incarnata (L.)

So\u00f3 is a highly polymorphic species listed as endangered in many regional red lists of Central Europe and Scandinavia. The dramatic decline of its populations during recent decades has been caused by the loss and degradation of their natural and semi-natural habitats (fens and wetmeadows,respectively) as a result of secondary succession following intensification or abandonment of traditional land use. In this study,weanalysed the effects of abandonment and re-introduction of mowing on the long-term (28 years) population dynamics of Dactylorhiza incarnata at Lake Barsbek in northern Germany. In this area, to preserve a remaining population of D. incarnata, an annual mowing regime was re-established in 1981 on siteM-1of the investigated plots after a period of abandonment. Annualmowingwasintroduced on a second site, M-2, in 1987. Two- to three-year mowing was introduced on a third site, M-3. Site A, abandonedsince 1970,wasused as a reference.Oneach of these sites, flowering individualswerecounted once a year. Population structure and accompanying vegetation were recorded simultaneously. In 2006, light measurements were carried out in the mowed areas. The D. incarnata population at M-1 increased exponentially during the first 10 years after re- introduction of mowing. Pronounced decreases in the number of flowering individuals were recorded in 1997 and 2003. Population dynamics at M-2 generally resembled the temporal development at M-1. D. incarnata disappeared on site A during the investigation period, while vegetation height and litter layer increased by 60 and 100%, respectively. D. incarnata was able to withstand reduced light availability to a certain extent by increasing its vertical growth (shade avoidance). It is concluded that the maintenance of D. incarnata populations in Central Europe requires continuation or re-establishment of wet meadow management. On previously abandoned sites, an initially higher mowing frequency is recommended. Management intensity can be reduced after phytomass production of the vegetation has declined.","uuid":"51354d79-a0aa-3a74-adb0-bd3ae73b080a","authors":[{"forename":"Joachim","surname":"Schrautzer"},{"forename":"Andreas","surname":"Fichtner"},{"forename":"Aiko","surname":"Huckauf"},{"forename":"Leonid","surname":"Rasran"},{"forename":"Kai","surname":"Jensen"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Schrautzer"},{"id":"6016479544","title":"Predicting the potential distribution of the invasive Common Waxbill Estrilda astrild (Passeriformes: Estrildidae)","type":"Journal Article","volume":"152","url":"http:\/\/www.springerlink.com\/index\/10.1007\/s10336-011-0662-9","tags":["2011","Aichi_B","birds","DE","GBIF_used","Germany","invasive","niche_modeling","SDM","Target_9","university"],"keywords":["climate change","ecological niche modelling","invasive species","maxent","niche overlap","species distribution model"],"pages":"769-780","year":"2011","abstract":"Human transport and commerce have led to an increased spread of non-indigenous species.

While many single-taxon studies have highlighted that species with narrow geographic ranges especially suffer from habitat modification, there is no multi-taxa study available which consistently focuses on geographic range composition of the studied indicator groups. We compiled geographic range data for 180 bird, 119 butterfly, 204 tree and 219 understorey plant species sampled along a gradient of habitat modification ranging from near-primary forest through young secondary forest and agroforestry systems to annual crops in the southwestern lowlands of Cameroon. We found very similar patterns of declining species richness with increasing habitat modification between taxon-specific groups of similar geographic range categories. At the 8 km(2) spatial level, estimated richness of endemic species declined in all groups by 21% (birds) to 91% (trees) from forests to annual crops, while estimated richness of widespread species increased by +101% (trees) to +275% (understorey plants), or remained stable (-2%, butterflies). Even traditional agroforestry systems lost estimated endemic species richness by -18% (birds) to -90% (understorey plants). Endemic species richness of one taxon explained between 37% and 57% of others (positive correlations) and taxon-specific richness in widespread species explained up to 76% of variation in richness of endemic species (negative correlations). The key implication of this study is that the range size aspect is fundamental in assessments of conservation value via species inventory data from modified habitats. The study also suggests that even ecologically friendly agricultural matrices may be of much lower value for tropical conservation than indicated by mere biodiversity value.","uuid":"385e6ef0-b46c-3116-8bdf-7f0257e34d17","authors":[{"forename":"Matthias","surname":"Waltert"},{"forename":"Kadiri Serge","surname":"Bobo"},{"forename":"Stefanie","surname":"Kaupa"},{"forename":"Marcela Leija","surname":"Montoya"},{"forename":"Moses Sainge","surname":"Nsanyi"},{"forename":"Heleen","surname":"Fermon"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"PloS one","firstAuthor":"Waltert"},{"id":"6016478064","title":"Species distribution models for the alien invasive Asian Harlequin ladybird (Harmonia axyridis)","type":"Journal Article","url":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/j.1439-0418.2010.01598.x","tags":["2010","DE","Europe_biodiversity","GBIF_used","Germany","invasive","ladybird","Maxent","niche_modeling","SDM"],"keywords":["bioclim","fundamental niche","intraspecific niche variation","Maxent","model transferability","potential distribution","realized niche"],"pages":"no-no","year":"2010","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","abstract":"Abstract The Asian Harlequin ladybird (Harmonia axyridis) is a globally invasive alien species.

SDMinv highlighted a restricted area in China which may represent the region of origin of the European Harlequin ladybird, leaving the possibility of within-species climate niche variation. As a result, when targeting the worldwide potential of invasiveness of H. axyridis, SDMall may reveal maximum results uncovering the species\u2019 potential distribution. These results have to be seen in the framework of conceptual problems and pitfalls when generating SDMs including niche definition, niche shift, sampling bias, biological importance of predictors and model transferability uncertainties.","uuid":"a2f4347e-7219-309c-810c-bba9f70403a0","authors":[{"forename":"K.","surname":"Bidinger"},{"forename":"S.","surname":"L\u00f6tters"},{"forename":"Dennis","surname":"R\u00f6dder"},{"forename":"M.","surname":"Veith"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Bidinger"},{"id":"6016476244","title":"Species of Cotoneaster (Rosaceae, Maloideae) indigenous to, naturalising or commonly cultivated in Central Europe","type":"Journal Article","volume":"40","issue":"1","url":"http:\/\/www.ingentaconnect.com\/content\/bgbm\/will\/2010\/00000040\/00000001\/art00002\nhttp:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.3372\/wi.40.40102\nhttp:\/\/openurl.ingenta.com\/content\/xref?genre=article&issn=0511-9618&volume=40&issue=1&spage=13","tags":["2010","Aichi_B","DE","GBIF_used","Germany","invasive","Target_9","university"],"keywords":["Additional key words: taxonomy","adventives","alien plants","China","neophytes","ornamental shrubs"],"pages":"13-45","year":"2010","abstract":"Several alien species of the Eurasian genus Cotoneaster are naturalising in Central Europe, apparently increasingly so, and some on a massive scale.

In the past, climatic oscillations caused changing sea levels and thus influenced the permeability of these sea straits.

Postglacial warming caused severe range shifts of such taxa into higher latitudes and altitudes. We selected the boreomontane butterfly Lycaena helle (Denis & Schifferm\u00fcller, 1775) as an example to demonstrate the genetic effects of range changes, and to document the recent status of highly fragmented remnant populations. We analysed five polymorphic microsatellite loci in 1059 individuals sampled at 50 different localities scattered over the European distribution area of the species. Genetic differentiation was strong among the mountain ranges of western Europe, but we did not detect similarly distinct genetic groups following a geographical pattern in the more eastern areas. The Fennoscandian populations form a separate genetic group, and provide evidence for a colonization from southern Finland via northern Scandinavia to south-central Sweden. Species distribution modelling suggests a large extension of the spatial distribution during the last glacial maximum, but highlights strong retractions to a few mountain areas under current conditions. These findings, combined with our genetic data, suggest a more or less continuous distribution of L. helle throughout central Europe at the end of the last ice age. As a consequence of postglacial warming, the species retreated northwards to Fennoscandia and escaped increasing temperatures through altitudinal shifts. Therefore, the species is today restricted to population remnants located at the mountain tops of western Europe, genetically isolated from each other, and evolved into genetically unique entities.

(Porifera, Demospongiae, Hadromerida, Tethyidae) is a new species from the Canadian Northeast Pacific. Its type locality is the infralittoral around Ohiat Islet, Barkely Sound, Vancouver Island in Canada. Tethya leysae sp. nov. is a medium-sized spherical sponge with a verrucose surface, orange-yellow to light red alive and white with a greyish core in ethanol. The highly variable oxyspherasters (25-115 \u00b5m in size, R\/C 0.34-0.69) are densely scattered almost throughout the entire cortex. The micrasters comprise acanthoxyspherasters, acanthostrongylasters, acanthotylasters and small oxyspherasters, which are present at low densities throughout the sponge and form a dense layer associated with the exopinacoderm. The megascleres and the auxiliary megascleres comprise oxeas and strongyloxeas. The new species is clearly distinguishable from the closely related T. californiana by the absence of spherules among the micrasters, the lack of an alveolar cortex and the extremely high density of megasters in the cortex. In addition, the R\/C values of the megasters differ between the two species and the oxyspherasters of T. leysae sp. nov. rarely display bent rays. The morphological differences between the species are confirmed by nucleotide and amino acid substitutions within the cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) mtDNA gene. Phylogenetic analyses group T. leysae sp. nov. with T. californiana, T. actinia and T. minuta, which together form a sister group to a Mediterranean- North Atlantic species cluster. Morphological analyses of the skeleton included x-ray microtomography (\u00b5CT) and virtual 3D reconstruction, which was used for the first time in conjunction with the description of a new sponge species. Microtomography permitted the visualization and analysis of spicules within the skeletal context or isolated in silico. The method represents a valuable extension to the sponge taxonomist\u2019s toolbox since it allows morphometric measurements in 3D. \u00b5CT will thus supplement classical morphological methods such as light and scanning electron microscopy.","uuid":"45c75742-f8e6-3e11-8e3e-d679418bf56d","authors":[{"forename":"Isabel","surname":"Heim"},{"forename":"Michael","surname":"Nickel"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Heim"},{"id":"6016477134","title":"Predicting the distributions of marine organisms at the global scale","type":"Journal Article","volume":"221","issue":"3","url":"http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/B6VBS-4XSCVHM-1\/2\/c8c322a135ca495968b2e0ae2d2b1a4c","tags":["2010","AU","Australia","BR","Brazil","DE","GB","GBIF_used","Germany","marine","niche_modeling","PH","Philippines","research institute","SDM","SE","Sweden","university"],"notes":"GBIF data was most likely used but it isn&#039;t explicitely stated.","keywords":["Expert review","Global marine biodiversity","Model comparison","Range maps","Species distribution modelling","Trawl surveys"],"pages":"467-478","year":"2010","abstract":"We present and evaluate AquaMaps, a presence-only species distribution modelling system that allows the incorporation of expert knowledge about habitat usage and was designed for maximum output of standardized species range maps at the global scale.

We apply species distribution models to assess possible future changes in the lizard\u2019s range, identify areas with high extinction risk meriting conservation efforts and analyze whether the Natura 2000 network in its current stage will offer a sufficient protection for the genetically most valuable lineages.

Also, two main patterns become evident: While the genetically less diverse north-western populations may be less affected by climate change, the climate change effects on the southern isolates and the genetically most diverse populations within the Central System may be devastating. To improve a successful prospective conservation of L. schreiberi the management of protected sites needs to consider the processes that threaten this species. Furthermore, our study highlights the urgent need to consider climate change effects on evolutionary significant units within the Natura 2000 framework.","uuid":"09949fef-1cb1-3d4f-b0ff-558cd251ca08","authors":[{"forename":"Dennis","surname":"R\u00f6dder"},{"forename":"Ulrich","surname":"Schulte"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Biodiversity and Conservation","firstAuthor":"R\u00f6dder"},{"id":"6016475704","title":"Spread of alien invasive Impatiens balfourii in Europe and its temperature, light and soil moisture demands","type":"Journal Article","volume":"205","issue":"11","url":"http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/B7GX0-508TDTY-2\/2\/04f282dab2e766ac6185a7733aa05fcd","tags":["2010","DE","GBIF_used","Germany","invasive"],"keywords":["Balsam","CO2 gas exchange","Impatiens","Neophytes","Soil moisture gradient"],"pages":"772-776","year":"2010","abstract":"Impatiens balfourii was introduced in the beginning of the 20th century from the Himalayas to Southern Europe where it was able to establish.
