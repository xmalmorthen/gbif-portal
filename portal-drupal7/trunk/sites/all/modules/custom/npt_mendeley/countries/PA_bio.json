These records extend the known geographic distribution of this species about 70 km eastwards. They also extend the known vertical distribution approximately 70 m uphill. Additionally, we provide the first record for the Caribbean slopes, an updated distribution map, photos of specimens from different localities, an analysis of a distress call, and comments on the morphology of this species.","uuid":"c2a3b67a-b15d-32a9-98dc-381da06e10c2","authors":[{"forename":"Joe-felix","surname":"Bienentreu"},{"forename":"Andreas","surname":"Hertz"},{"forename":"Sebastian","surname":"Lotzkat"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Bienentreu"},{"id":"6016482224","title":"New distribution records and variation of the two common lowland salamanders Bolitoglossa colonnea (Dunn, 1924) and B. lignicolor (Peters, 1873) in Panama (Amphibia: Caudata: Plethodontidae)","type":"Journal Article","volume":"9","issue":"1","url":"http:\/\/www.checklist.org.br\/getpdf?NGD151-12","tags":["2013","Aichi_E","DE","GBIF_used","Germany","Panama_biodiversity","Target_19"],"keywords":[],"pages":"83-91","year":"2013","abstract":"We revise the geographic distribution of two common lowland salamanders in western Panama.
