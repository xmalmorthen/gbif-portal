In addition,we used niche-based ensemble modelling techniques to assess current invasion risk of the region studied.We collated 1804 records of A. annua, 1063 of I. xanthiifolia and 324 of A. trifida. All species were first recorded in the 19th century, remained rare until the middle of the 20th century, but have spread rapidly in recent decades. Iva xanthiifolia spread the fastest followed by A. annua. The latter species is nowabundant in northern Italy, along the Elbe river in Germany and the Danubian Lowland in Slovakia and Hungary, while I. xanthiifolia occurs most frequently in the warm and continental parts of CEE. Ambrosia trifida spread slowly and its current distribution con- sists of relatively few and mostly isolated localities in CEE. Ambrosia trifida and I. xanthiifolia occur primarily in ruderal habitats, whereas I. xanthiifolia has also increasingly invaded fields. Ini- tially confined to ruderal habitats, A. annua has expanded its habitat niche during the invasion and has invaded riverine vegetation and (semi-)natural habitats. Ensemble species-distribution models showthat the current distribution of A. trifida and A. annua in CEE is closely related to temperature and precipitation, whereas land use is only important for I. xanthiifolia. Under the current climate, substantial fractions of the study area provide suitable habitat for these species: A. trifida (16% of CEE), A. annua (28%) and I. xanthiifolia (26%). Because of their significant potential impact on public health, future spread of these species should be monitored and management strategies (e.g. raising awareness, early control) should urgently be implemented.","uuid":"5a6556fc-bd64-3ffd-b3d6-7e4c81ba6904","authors":[{"forename":"Swen","surname":"Follak"},{"forename":"Stefan","surname":"Dullinger"},{"forename":"Ingrid","surname":"Kleinbauer"},{"forename":"Dietmar","surname":"Moser"},{"forename":"Franz","surname":"Essl"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Follak"},{"id":"6016484704","title":"Pest occurrence model in current climate \u2013 validation study for European domain","type":"Journal Article","volume":"61","issue":"1","url":"http:\/\/acta.mendelu.cz\/61\/1\/0205\/","tags":["2013","Aichi_B","AT","Austria","CLIMEX","CZ","Czech Republic","Europe_biodiversity","GBIF_used","GBits_8","invasive","SDM","Target_9"],"keywords":[],"pages":"205-214","year":"2013","abstract":"The present study yields detail validation of the pest occurrence models under current climate in wide European domain.

Two approaches for the selection of priority populations for conservation were used, differing in the way they optimize representation of intra-specific diversity of P. africana across a minimum number of populations. The first method (S1) was aimed at maximizing genetic diversity of the conservation units and their distinctiveness with regard to climatic conditions, the second method (S2) at optimizing representativeness of the genetic diversity found throughout the species\u2019 range. Populations in East African countries (especially Kenya and Tanzania) were found to be of great conservation value, as suggested by previous findings. These populations are complemented by those in Madagascar and Cameroon. The combination of the two methods for prioritization led to the identification of a set of 6 priority populations. The potential distribution of P. africana was then modeled based on a dataset of 1,500 georeferenced observations. This enabled an assessment of whether the priority populations identified are exposed to threats from agricultural expansion and climate change, and whether they are located within the boundaries of protected areas. The range of the species has been affected by past climate change and the modeled distribution of P. africana indicates that the species is likely to be negatively affected in future, with an expected decrease in distribution by 2050. Based on these insights, further research at the regional and national scale is recommended, in order to strengthen P. africana conservation efforts.","uuid":"94835341-933e-324a-9094-680d017f9471","authors":[{"forename":"Barbara","surname":"Vinceti"},{"forename":"Judy","surname":"Loo"},{"forename":"Hannes","surname":"Gaisberger"},{"forename":"Maarten J.","surname":"van Zonneveld"},{"forename":"Silvio","surname":"Schueler"},{"forename":"Heino","surname":"Konrad"},{"forename":"Caroline a.

We analysed range-wide genetic diversity (amplified fragment length polymorphisms) in 9581 samples from 1200 populations of 27 northern plant species, to assess genetic consequences of range reduction and potential association with species traits. We used species distribution modelling (SDM, eight techniques, two global circulation models and two emission scenarios) to predict loss of range and genetic diversity by 2080. Loss of genetic diversity varied considerably among species, and this variation could be explained by dispersal adaptation (up to 57%) and by genetic differentiation among populations (F(ST); up to 61%). Herbs lacking adaptations for long-distance dispersal were estimated to lose genetic diversity at higher rate than dwarf shrubs adapted to long-distance dispersal. The expected range reduction in these 27 northern species was larger than reported for temperate plants, and all were predicted to lose genetic diversity according to at least one scenario. SDM combined with F(ST) estimates and\/or with species trait information thus allows the prediction of species' vulnerability to climate change, aiding rational prioritization of conservation efforts.","uuid":"1da28b18-63b0-3e3c-8b95-966403791f90","authors":[{"forename":"Inger Greve","surname":"Alsos"},{"forename":"Dorothee","surname":"Ehrich"},{"forename":"Wilfried","surname":"Thuiller"},{"forename":"Pernille Bronken","surname":"Eidesen"},{"forename":"Andreas","surname":"Tribsch"},{"forename":"Peter","surname":"Sch\u00f6nswetter"},{"forename":"Claire","surname":"Lagaye"},{"forename":"Pierre","surname":"Taberlet"},{"forename":"Christian","surname":"Brochmann"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Proceedings.

The first record of S. halepense was recorded in 1871, but the species remained rare until 1970. After a moderate increase in records until 1990, it has recently expanded strongly (>70% of all records have been collected since 1990), in particular, in the lowlands of eastern and southern Austria. Invasion into fields was first documented in the 1970s, but again, since 1990, S. halepense has spread strongly and fields now account for 32% of all records. In southern Austria, we found that S. halepense invasion already puts approximately 41% of grain maize fields and 40% of oil-pumpkin fields at risk of yield losses. In cooler regions within Austria, S. halepense is still rarely recorded in fields. Sorghum halepense serves as a reservoir for the maize dwarf mosaic virus, as it was found in 38% of 21 samples collected in southern Austria. Invasion of S. halepense in fields was most likely assisted by frequent secondary dispersal and intensive maize and oil-pumpkin cultivation. Given the fast and on-going spread in fields, which is likely to continue under climate warming, our results provide evidence that S. halepense will cause serious impacts for agriculture in Austria and probably in other countries of Central Europe.","uuid":"c8c81db2-838a-30de-982a-ed2e3f06f31c","authors":[{"forename":"Swen","surname":"Follak"},{"forename":"Franz","surname":"Essl"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Follak"},{"id":"6016483544","title":"Morphological and chemical studies on Platismatia erosa (Parmeliaceae) from Tibet, Nepal and Bhutan","type":"Journal Article","volume":"115","issue":"1","url":"http:\/\/www.bioone.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1639\/0007-2745-115.1.51\nhttp:\/\/www.uni-graz.at\/~oberma\/platismatia-erosa-tibet-obermayer+randlane-2012.pdf","tags":["2012","Aichi_E","AT","Austria","Bhutan_biodiversity","EE","Estonia","GBIF_used","Nepal_biodiversity","species distribution","Target_19","taxonomy","Tibet_biodiversity","university"],"keywords":["chemotypes","conidia","Lichen","Platismatia glauca","taxonomy"],"pages":"51-60","year":"2012","abstract":"The occurrence of Platismatia erosa in Tibet and adjacent regions is reported.

This paper reports the results from a systematic literature review approach that sought to determine the geographic distribution of \u2018Ca. Phytoplasma prunorum\u2019 in European fruit-growing areas. Evidence for the presence of the phytoplasma was found for 15 of the 27 EU countries. It is prevalent in the most important stone fruit production areas of Central and Southern Europe, where it causes substantial impact in apricots (Prunus armeniaca), Japanese plums (P. salicina) and peaches (P. persica). In Northern European areas where these hosts are not produced, it is occasion- ally found on tolerant species (P. domestica). However, because surveys of the disease sta- tus of tolerant hosts are not performed, it remains unclear whether the pathogen is absent in Northern Europe or survives in tolerant cultivated or wild hosts. No reports of ESFY were found from the southernmost part of Europe: Portugal, Spain (Andalucia, Castile\u2013La Man- cha), Italy (Sicily, Puglia), Greece (Crete), Cyprus and Malta. This may be explained by the absence of the favoured wild hosts of the vector. Moreover, it remains unclear if the vector finds suitable conditions for aestivation and overwintering in these regions. Introduction European stone fruit yellows (EFSY) is an important disease affecting Prunus spp., which is caused by \u2018Candida- tus Phytoplasma prunorum\u2019. This pathogen is currently reg- ulated in Annex I\/AII of the EC directive 2000\/29 as \u2018apricot chlorotic leafroll mycoplasma\u2019 and requirements for the movement of Prunus plants are set out in Annex IV. ESFY symptoms were first observed in France on apri- \u00b4pe cot (P. armeniaca), and described as \u2018de \u00b4rissement de l\u2019abricotier par apoplexie\u2019 (Chabrolin, 1924). Then \u2018plum leptonecrosis\u2019 (PLN) was described on Japanese plum (P. salicina) in Italy (Goida `nich, 1934). In 1965, Morvan and Castelain named the disease \u2018enroulement chlorotique de l\u2019abricotier\u2019 (ECA) (\u2018apricot chlorotic leafroll\u2019, ACLR). Symptoms of \u2018peach yellowing\u2019 were also associated with severe declines on P. persica (Poggi Pollini et al., 1993). Finally, all these symptoms on Prunus have been associ- ated with genetically very similar phytoplasma, and the name \u2018European stone fruit yellows\u2019 was proposed for the disease (Lorenz et al., 1994). Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the ESFY agent is closely related to the Pear Decline and Apple Proliferation pathogens, constitut- ing the 16SrX group, and the name \u2018Candidatus Phytopl- asma prunorum\u2019 was proposed (Seemu 2004). \u00a8ller & Schneider, Symptoms of ESFY are obvious only in P. armeniaca, P. salicina and P. persica, whereas other important stone fruit species are either tolerant, usually not showi","uuid":"a689325d-6a01-3f17-b1e6-517db2c852cc","authors":[{"forename":"R.","surname":"Steffek"},{"forename":"Swen","surname":"Follak"},{"forename":"N.","surname":"Sauvion"},{"forename":"G.","surname":"Labonne"},{"forename":"A.","surname":"MacLeod"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Steffek"},{"id":"6016478784","title":"Potential distribution and environmental threat of Pueraria lobata","type":"Journal Article","volume":"6","issue":"3","url":"http:\/\/www.springerlink.com\/index\/10.2478\/s11535-010-0120-3","tags":["2011","Aichi_B","AT","Austria","GBIF_used","invasive","Target_9"],"keywords":["CLIMEX","Damage niche","Invasive alien plants","Kudzu","Management"],"pages":"457-469","year":"2011","abstract":"Pueraria lobata (kudzu) is an invasive weed originating from East Asia.

Summary Solanum carolinense is a serious weed from North America that has recently invaded crop fields in Austria and Italy. In this study, a climate suitability analysis using the CLIMEX model was carried out, to assess the potential distribution of S. carolinense in Central Europe, to identify areas at risk of an invasion and to derive an efficient management strategy. In North America, the plant currently occupies almost its full range of suitable climates. In contrast, S. carolinense occurs only rarely as a ruderal plant and weed in several countries of Central Europe. The projections of climatic suitability under current climate reveal considerable scope for further invasion. The land area climatically suitable for S. carolinense is highest in Hungary (100% of the total land area), Poland (83.6%), followed by Slovenia (70.5%), Slovakia (64.5%), Germany (41.5%), Czech Republic (37.0%), Austria (34.9%) and Switzerland (16.6%). Solanum carolinense has a high capacity for spatial dispersal by natural means and different human-mediated pathways. Thus, it is likely that the plant will expand its range and infest cultivated land, particularly around existing naturalised populations. A management strategy is warranted, including early detection and eradication of nascent foci of S. carolinense, to contain the plant to its current restricted distribution and to limit the chances for further spread of this invasive weed to other agricultural areas. The widespread occurrence of this species would have serious consequences for agriculture.","uuid":"38942f14-215f-329c-80a0-ce6a64152a56","authors":[{"forename":"Swen","surname":"Follak"},{"forename":"G.","surname":"Strauss"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Weed Research","firstAuthor":"Follak"}]
