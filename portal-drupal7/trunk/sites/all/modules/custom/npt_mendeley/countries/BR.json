The hill remained forested; however, clear signals of structural change are seen in the record, which indicate that the area experienced a significantly drier climate during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM).

Together with its associated floodplain water bodies, this Neotropical river system supports a freshwater biodiversity of worldwide conservation significance, but one increasingly affected by human pressures, particularly the effects of river impoundment. Multivariate analysis of data from repeated (2000\u20132002 and 2011) macrophyte\u2013environment surveys of a set of stations within a 230 km stretch of functioning riverine floodplain, downstream of the most recently completed dam on the Upper Paran\u00e1, the Porto Primavera Dam, together with published data (from 1999 and 2005\u20132007), was used to test the hypothesis that human influences might outweigh the importance of natural factors in driving the aquatic vegetation dynamics (macrophyte community composition, alpha-diversity, and abundance) of this system during the period 1999\u20132011. The macrophyte communities present showed differences of species composition and abundance that could be strongly related to the scale and duration of the immediately preceding annual flood pulse, as well as local variations in physico-chemical conditions. For rare Neotropical endemic species, which are a good marker of the conservation status of the system, there was a reasonable degree of stability between the 2000\u20132002 and 2011 survey periods, with eight of 16 such species being present in both surveys, three present in 2000\u20132002 only, but an additional five such species found only in 2011. The conclusion is that vegetation changes in the system can be referred both to direct human impacts (river regulation), and to indirect human or natural impacts (floods, alien species invasion by Hydrilla verticillata, and local environmental factors). Overall there was evidence that major floods associated with El Ni\u00f1o - Southern Oscillation (ENSO) climatic events had a much greater impact than other drivers, whether natural or anthropogenic.","uuid":"77cc02ee-b410-3c6d-b6a4-419f5f2fb54c","authors":[{"forename":"Sara Varandas","surname":"Martins"},{"forename":"Judith","surname":"Milne"},{"forename":"Sidinei Magela","surname":"Thomaz"},{"forename":"Stephanie","surname":"McWaters"},{"forename":"Roger Paulo","surname":"Mormul"},{"forename":"Michael","surname":"Kennedy"},{"forename":"Kevin","surname":"Murphy"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Aquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems","firstAuthor":"Martins"},{"id":"6221367574","title":"Niche modelling for twelve plant species (six timber species and six palm trees) in the Amazon region, using collection and field survey data","type":"Journal Article","url":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0378112713006063","tags":["2013","Aichi_E","Bolivia_biodiversity","BR","Brazil","Brazil_biodiversity","Colombia_biodiversity","conservation","ecology","Ecuador_biodiversity","GBIF_used","GBits_11","Guianas_biodiversity","in_press","Maxent","Peru_biodiversity","SDM","species distribution","Target_19","Venezuela_biodiversity"],"keywords":["Amazon","Field surveys","Herbarium","Modelling","Palm","Timber"],"year":"2013","publisher":"Elsevier B.V.","abstract":"Knowledge of the distribution of plant species is essential for planning management and conservation actions, especially for economically important species. Available data on plant species in the Amazon usually do not represent their whole area of occurrence. The most widely used approach to infer predictions on species occurrence is niche modelling, which consists of correlating records of species with environmental conditions in their occurrence areas, generating maps with the potential distribution based on a combination of environmental features suitable for each species. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of modelling to improve knowledge on the distribution of six timber species and six palm trees in the Amazon, and whether these models can benefit from using data from field surveys added to those of biological collections. Models were generated using the Maxent algorithm. All models generated showed a low extrinsic omission rate (TOE) and AUC above 0.75. Areas predicted for timber species were more consistent with empirical knowledge than those predicted for palm trees, probably due to the greater amount of occurrence sites available for timber species, especially after adding data from field surveys. The extent of the predicted area and the Jaccard index were used to compare the maps after insertion of field survey data. There was a large difference in extent just for two species, one timber and one palm, and a reduction in the predicted area for one species, Swietenia macrophylla. The application of the Jaccard index resulted in values between 0.41 and 0.65 for timber species, reinforcing that the inclusion of field survey data changed predicted areas. For palms, the similar extent of predicted areas and Jaccard values above 0.80, indicated a subtle difference between maps generated before and after the inclusion of field survey records, probably due to the addition of fewer records. The exception was Astrocaryum murumuru, for which the new records increased the extent of the predicted area. The niche models associated with field studies can contribute enormously to increase knowledge concerning the current distribution of species, but new field surveys should be carefully designed to cover wide and undersampled areas. However, it is necessary to consider that this strategy can only be adopted for species with clearly distinctive features, for which field identifications are reliable.","uuid":"b6840e9e-5cee-3aa8-9d93-fe52ad3893b2","authors":[{"forename":"Valdenice","surname":"Moscoso"},{"forename":"Ana Luisa","surname":"Albernaz"},{"forename":"Rafael De Paiva","surname":"Salom\u00e3o"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Moscoso"},{"id":"6016483364","title":"Niche conservatism and the potential for the crayfish Procambarus clarkii to invade South America","type":"Journal Article","url":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/fwb.12134","tags":["2013","Aichi_B","BR","Brazil","freshwater","GBIF_used","GBits_8","invasive","maxent","Mexico_biodiversity","niche_modeling","Portugal_biodiversity","SDM","Spain_biodiversity","Target_9","USA_biodiversity"],"keywords":["biodiversity conservation","crayfish alien species","invasive species","neotropical conservation","species distribution modelling"],"year":"2013","abstract":"1. Invasive species are one of the most severe threats to biodiversity, and an ability to predict the extent of potential invasions can help conservation strategies. Species distribution models (SDMs) have been widely used to project the potential range of invasive species. These models assume that species retain their niche properties during invasion (niche conservatism), although this assumption is seldom verified. 2. We gathered occurrence records for the crayfish Procambarus clarkii from the U.S.A. and Mexico (native + invasive ranges) and from the Iberian Peninsula (invasive) to test for niche conservatism across continents using niche overlap metrics (Schoener\u2019s D). To test for differences in the climate space occupied by the species on the different continents, we performed two principal component analyses (PCAs) on the environmental data extracted from occurrence records: first, separately for each occurrence data set (i.e. each continent) and secondly, using the pooled data. Subsequently, we projected the model to South America, where this species has the potential to become invasive. 3. Schoener\u2019s D showed high overlap (0.68) between the two regions (the Americas and Iberia), and there was no difference between the regions in both PCAs. The crayfish has conserved its niche across continents, and therefore, our model projection to South America may accurately demonstrate where invasion is most likely to occur. 4. Large parts of South America are apparently suitable, mainly Argentina, Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay and southern Brazil. This result is of great concern since this invasive species can spread quickly in suitable areas. Stronger laws and regulations should be made to protect native biodiversity and agri- cultural land. Our approach could be replicated for the study of invasions by other species where extensive data on the potentially invaded areas are available.","uuid":"9b1135e2-d20a-30f4-8363-473aad2446a4","authors":[{"forename":"Alexandre V.","surname":"Palaoro"},{"forename":"Marcelo M.","surname":"Dalosto"},{"forename":"Gabriel C.","surname":"Costa"},{"forename":"Sandro","surname":"Santos"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Palaoro"},{"id":"6016482084","title":"Predicting the current distribution and potential spread of the exotic grass Eragrostis plana Nees in South America and identifying a bioclimatic niche shift during invasion","type":"Journal Article","volume":"online","url":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/j.1442-9993.2012.02399.x","tags":["2012","Aichi_B","BR","Brazil","GBIF_used","invasive","in_press","niche_modeling","SDM","South Africa","South America_biodiversity","Target_9","university","ZA"],"keywords":["bioclimatic variable","ecological niche model","garp","invasive grass","native pasture"],"pages":"no-no","year":"2012","abstract":"Eragrostis plana (Poaceae) is a perennial grass introduced from South Africa to the state of Rio Grande do Sul in southern Brazil.

The 5 aim of this work was to achieve a description of VOC emissions from poorly described tropical vegetation to be compared with the quite well investigated and highly heterogeneous emissions from Mediterranean vegetation. For this task, common plant species of both ecosystems were investigated. Sixteen plant species from the Mediterranean area, which is known for its special diversity in VOC emitting 10 plant species, were chosen. In contrast, little information is currently available regarding emissions of VOCs from tropical tree species at the leaf level. Twelve plant species from different environments of the Amazon basin, i.e. Terra firme, V\u00b4arzea and Igap\u00b4 o, were screened for emission of VOCs at leaf level with a branch enclosure system. Analysis of the volatile organics was performed online by a proton-transfer-reaction 15 mass spectrometer (PTR-MS) and offline by collection on adsorbent tubes and subsequent gas chromatographic analysis. Isoprene was quantitatively the most dominant compound emitted followed by monoterpenes, methanol and acetone. Most of the Mediterranean species emitted a variety of monoterpenes, whereas only five tropical species were monoterpene emitters exhibiting a quite conservative emission pattern 20 ( -pinene>limonene>sabinene> -pinene). Mediterranean plants showed additional emissions of sesquiterpenes, whereas in the case of plants from the Amazon region no sesquiterpenes were detected probably due to a lack of sensitivity in the measuring systems. On the other hand methanol emissions, an indicator of growth, were common in most of the tropical and Mediterranean species. A few species from both ecosys25 tems showed acetone emissions. The observed heterogeneous emissions including reactive VOC species which are not easily detected by flux measurements, give reason to perform more screening at leaf level and, whenever possible, within the forests under ambient conditions.","uuid":"31dd3375-23ef-3586-9515-531534ce1532","authors":[{"forename":"A.","surname":"Bracho-Nunez"},{"forename":"N.

Phylogenetic analyses based on median-joining network showed no haplotype sharing among population but strong evidence of incomplete lineage sorting.

However, there are many sources of uncertainty in SDM that may restrict the ability of models to hindcast palaeo-distributions and provide a basis for hypothesis testing in molecular phylogenetics and phylogeographical studies. Location Seasonally dry forests (SDFs) in South America. Methods We addressed the problem of using palaeodistribution modelling for SDFs based on the projection of their current distribution into past environments (21 ka) using 11 methods for SDMs and five coupled atmosphere\u2013ocean global circulation models (AOGCMs) for 16 species. Results We observed considerable uncertainty in the hindcasts, with the most important effects for AOGCM (median 12.2%), species (median 15.6%) and their interaction (median 13.6%). The effects of AOGCMs were stronger in the Amazon region, whereas the species effect occurred primarily in the dry areas of central Brazil. The log-linear model detected significant effects of the three sources of variation and their interaction on the classification of each map in supporting alternative hypotheses. An expansion scenario combining the Pleistocene arc and Amazonian expansion, and Pennington's Amazonian expansion alone, were the most frequently supported palaeodistribution scenarios. Main conclusions As a basis for evaluating a given hypothesis, hindcast distributions must be used in direct association with other evidence, such as molecular variation and the fossil record. We propose an alternative framework concerning hypothesis testing that couples SDM and phylogeographical work, in which palaeoclimatic distributions and other sources of information, such as the pollen fossil record and coalescence modelling, must be weighted equally.","uuid":"19bad428-b71b-3de9-a37e-d78c4ed9b8c3","authors":[{"forename":"Rosane G.","surname":"Collevatti"},{"forename":"Levi Carina","surname":"Terribile"},{"forename":"Guilherme","surname":"de Oliveira"},{"forename":"Matheus S.","surname":"Lima-Ribeiro"},{"forename":"Jo\u00e3o C.","surname":"Nabout"},{"forename":"Thiago F.","surname":"Rangel"},{"forename":"Jos\u00e9 Alexandre Felizola","surname":"Diniz-Filho"}],"editors":[{"forename":"Richard","surname":"Pearson"}],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Collevatti"},{"id":"6016483484","title":"Continental-scale variability in browser diversity is a major driver of diversity patterns in acacias across Africa","type":"Journal Article","volume":"100","url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1365-2745.2012.01994.x\/abstract","tags":["2012","Africa_biodiversity","Aichi_E","BE","Belgium","BR","Brazil","DE","Denmark","DK","GB","GBIF_used","Germany","Netherlands","niche_modeling","NL","plants","SDM","Target_19"],"keywords":["diversity patterns","herbivory","plant\u2013herbivore interactions","Quaternary climate change","resource\u2013consumer relationships","savanna species","speciation"],"pages":"1093-1104","year":"2012","abstract":"1. It has been proposed that, across broad spatial scales, climatic factors are the main drivers of ecological patterns, while biotic factors are mainly important at local spatial scales. However, few tests of the effect of biotic interactions on broad-scale patterns have been conducted; conclusions about the scale-dependence of the importance of biotic interactions thus seem premature. 2. We developed an extensive database of locality records of one of Africa\u2019s most conspicuous groups, the acacias (the genera Senegalia and Vachellia), and used species distribution models (SDMs) to estimate the distribution of all African acacias. 3. African acacias are particularly well adapted against mammalian herbivory; therefore, we hypothesized that browser diversity could be an important driver of acacia richness. Species richness maps for the two genera were created from SDM-generated maps. Ordinary least square (OLS) regressions and, to consider spatial autocorrelation, simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) analyses were used to model richness of the two genera in relation to mammalian browser richness, current environment (including climate), and climate history since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). We used variation partitioning to determine what percentage of variation could be explained by these three groups of factors. 4. Both genera showed centres of richness in East Africa and the Limpopo Basin of southern Africa. Browser richness was the best explanatory variable for richness of both genera. Environmental factors explained negligible variation in the richness of Senegalia, but some variation in Vachellia. For both genera, the residuals of the species richness model of one genus also explained much variation in the richness of the other genus, indicating that common factors not considered in the richness analyses here may additionally be driving the richness of both genera. 5.

In a short time span starting at 34 Mya, ancestors of Gesnerioideae colonized several Neotropical regions including the tropical Andes, Brazilian Atlantic forest, cerrado, Central America and the West Indies. Subsequent diversification within these areas occurred largely in situ and was particularly extensive in the mountainous systems of the Andes, Central America and the Brazilian Atlantic forest. Only two radiations account for 90% of the diversity of Gesneriaceae in the Brazilian Atlantic forest, whereas half of the species richness in the northern Andes and Central America originated during the last 10 Myr from a single radiation. \u00a9","uuid":"defe30d7-62c3-3a35-b1e5-928d4d5c0292","authors":[{"forename":"Mathieu","surname":"Perret"},{"forename":"Alain","surname":"Chautems"},{"forename":"Andr\u00e9a Onofre","surname":"De Araujo"},{"forename":"Nicolas","surname":"Salamin"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society","firstAuthor":"Perret"},{"id":"6016484824","title":"Can species distribution modelling provide estimates of population densities?

We tested whether models\u2019 suitability is linearly correlated with jaguar population densities estimated from 37 different locations. We evaluated whether the relationship between density and suitability forms a constraint envelope, in which higher densities are found mainly in regions with high suitability, whereas low densities can occur in regions with variable suitability. We tested this using heteroscedasticity test and quantile regressions. Results A positive linear relationship between suitability and jaguar density was found only for four methods [bioclimatic envelope (BIOCLIM), genetic algorithm for rule set production (GARP), maximum entropy (Maxent) and generalized boosting models (GBM)], but with weak explanatory power. BIOCLIM showed the strongest relationship. Variance of suitability for lower densities values was larger than for higher values for many of the SDM models used, but the quantile regression was significantly positive only for BIOCLIM and random forests (RF). RF and GBM provided the most accurate models when measured with the standard SDM evaluation metrics, but possess poor relationship with local density estimates. Main conclusions Results indicate that the relationship between density and suitability could be better described as a triangular constraint envelope than by a straight positive relationship, and some of the SDM methods tested here were able to discriminate regions with high or low local population densities. Low jaguar densities can occur in areas with low or high suitability, whereas high values are restricted to areas where the suitability is greater. In high suitability areas but with low jaguar density estimates, we discuss how extrinsic factors driving abundance could act at local scales and then prevent higher densities that would be expected by the favourable regional environmental conditions.","uuid":"08e7ff3a-b279-371c-ab29-ba1d3b089cee","authors":[{"forename":"Nat\u00e1lia M.","surname":"T\u00f4rres"},{"forename":"Paulo","surname":"De Marco"},{"forename":"Thiago","surname":"Santos"},{"forename":"Leandro","surname":"Silveira"},{"forename":"Anah T.","surname":"de Almeida J\u00e1como"},{"forename":"Jos\u00e9 Alexandre Felizola","surname":"Diniz-Filho"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"T\u00f4rres"},{"id":"6016482794","title":"Range shifts under climate change and the role of protected areas for armadillos and anteaters","type":"Journal Article","volume":"152","url":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0006320712001929","tags":["2012","Aichi_C","BR","Brazil","Brazil_biodiversity","conservation","GBIF_used","Target_11","university"],"keywords":["Climate change","Dispersal","Gap analysis","Reserve system","Species-distribution modeling","Xenarthra"],"pages":"53-61","year":"2012","abstract":"The planning of protected areas take into consideration the current distributions of target species, disre- garding possible future range shifts under climate change.

However, there is a lack of infor- mation about how this tolerance influences invasiveness of exotic species in ecosystems with seasonal drought. To address this question for Mediterranean-type ecosystems (MTE) of the Iberian Peninsula, we carried out an experiment with fifteen phylogenetically related species (8 invasive and 7 native, Pinus pinaster Ait., Pinus radiata D. Don, Schinus molle Linn., Elaeagnus angustifolia L., Eucalyptus globulus Labill., Acacia melanoxylon R. Br., Gleditsia triacanthos L., Pistacia terebinthus L., Rhamnus alaternus L., Anagyris foetida L., Colutea arborescens L., Oenothera biennis L., Epilobium hirsutum L., Achillea filipendulina Lam. and Achillea millefolium L). Seedlings were grown and maximal photochemical efficiency of PSII (Fv\/Fm) was measured at two water availabilities (well-watered and with water stress). PSII thermal tolerance mea- surements were related to specific leaf area (SLA), which varied significantly across the study species, and to the mean potential evapotranspiration (PET) of the month with the lowest precipitation in the native areas of both groups and in the invaded area of the Iberian Peninsula. Additionally, PSII thermal tolerance measurements under water stress were phylogenetically explored. Invasive and native species neither differed in SLA nor in their thermal tolerance under well-watered conditions. For well-watered plants, SLA was significantly and positively related to PSII thermal tolerance when all species were explored together regardless of their invasive nature. However, this relationship did not persist under water stress and invasive species had higher plastic responses than Mediterranean natives resulting in higher leaf temperatures. Higher PSII thermal tolerance could explain invasiveness because it allows for longer peri- ods of carbon acquisition under water stress. In fact, PSII thermal tolerance was positively related to the PET of the invaded and native areas of the Iberian Peninsula. PSII thermal tolerance was not related to PET at the native range of the invasive species, suggesting that successful invasive species were plastic enough to cope with novel dry conditions of the Iberian Peninsula. Moreover, our phylogenetic results indicate that future scenarios of increased aridity in MTE associated to climate change will filter invasion success by taxonomic identity. This study reveals the importance of studying ecophysiological traits to understand and better predict future biological invasions.","uuid":"83c22d09-c7f1-3b49-bdff-5d0b7f359ef1","authors":[{"forename":"Oscar","surname":"Godoy"},{"forename":"Jos\u00e9 Pires","surname":"de Lemos-Filho"},{"forename":"Fernando","surname":"Valladares"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Godoy"},{"id":"6016480034","title":"Can Species Richness Patterns Be Interpolated From a Limited Number of Well-Known Areas?

Invasive species modify ecosystem structure and functioning and climatic changes are likely to produce invasive species' range shifts pushing some populations into protected areas. The American Bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus) is one of the hundred worst invasive species in the world. Native from the southeast of USA, it has colonized more than 75% of South America where it has been reported as a highly effective predator, competitor and vector of amphibian diseases. Methodology\/Principal Findings: We modeled the potential distribution of the bullfrog in its native range based on different climate models and green-house gases emission scenarios, and projected the results onto South America for the years of 2050 and 2080. We also overlaid projected models onto the South American network of protected areas. Our results indicate a slight decrease in potential suitable area for bullfrog invasion, although protected areas will become more climatically suitable. Therefore, invasion of these sites is forecasted. Conclusion\/Significance: We provide new evidence supporting the vulnerability of the Atlantic Forest Biodiversity Hotspot to bullfrog invasion and call attention to optimal future climatic conditions of the Andean-Patagonian forest, eastern Paraguay, and northwestern Bolivia, where invasive populations have not been found yet. We recommend several management and policy strategies to control bullfrog invasion and argue that these would be possible if based on appropriate articulation among government agencies, NGOs, research institutions and civil society.","uuid":"50cab368-70a6-3666-95ae-b27c84651ba5","authors":[{"forename":"Javier","surname":"Nori"},{"forename":"J.

Within South America diversity is not distributed evenly at both local and continental scales and this has led to the recognition of various areas with unique species assemblages. Several schemes currently exist which divide the continental-level diversity into large species assemblages referred to as biomes. Here we review five currently available biome maps for South America, including the WWF Ecoregions, the Americas basemap, the Land Cover Map of South America, Morrone\u2019s Biogeographic regions of Latin America, and the Ecological Systems Map. The comparison is performed through a case study on the Seasonally Dry Tropical Forest (SDTF) biome using herbarium data of habitat specialist species. Results Current biome maps of South America perform poorly in depicting SDTF distribution. The poor performance of the maps can be attributed to two main factors: (1) poor spatial resolution, and (2) poor biome delimitation. Poor spatial resolution strongly limits the use of some of the maps in GIS applications, especially for areas with heterogeneous landscape such as the Andes. Whilst the Land Cover Map did not suffer from poor spatial resolution, it showed poor delimitation of biomes. The results highlight that delimiting structurally heterogeneous vegetation is difficult based on remote sensed data alone. A new refined working map of South American SDTF biome is proposed, derived using the Biome Distribution Modelling (BDM) approach where georeferenced herbarium data is used in conjunction with bioclimatic data. Conclusions Georeferenced specimen data play potentially an important role in biome mapping. Our study shows that herbarium data could be used as a way of ground-truthing biome maps in silico. The results also illustrate that herbarium data can be used to model vegetation maps through predictive modelling. The BDM approach is a promising new method in biome mapping, and could be particularly useful for mapping poorly known, fragmented, or degraded vegetation. We wish to highlight that biome delimitation is not an exact science, and that transparency is needed on how biomes are used as study units in macroevolutionary and ecological research.","uuid":"84e50621-0ab3-384b-a1c3-be04cab594dd","authors":[{"forename":"Tiina","surname":"Sarkinen"},{"forename":"Joao R.

To evaluate whether large-scale abiotic factors can explain a successful introduction of both P. formosa and Poecilia latipinna. Location South-east United States, Mexico and Central America. Methods We used abiotic variables in ecological niche modelling (ENM) to identify regions with suitable conditions for the presence of the Amazon molly and its two parental species (P. latipinna and Poecilia mexicana). We also used a recently developed metric to calculate the degree of niche overlap between the hybrid and its parental species. Results ENM produced highly significant models [all area under the curve (AUC) > 0.99 for the three species]. Annual mean temperature and minimum temperature of the coldest month were the variables that best explained the distribution of the Amazon molly. With the exception of south Florida, few areas beyond the known distribution of the species were predicted to have suitable environmental conditions. The hybrid species niche overlaps partially with the parental species. However, given the available data, it is neither more similar nor more different than expected by chance. Main conclusions Two different processes are acting to limit the distribution of P. formosa. At the northern limit, although a sperm donor species is present further north, suitable environmental conditions are absent from nearby locations. At the southern limit, a sperm donor species is present and areas with good environmental conditions are present at nearby locations, suggesting that dispersal ability is the limiting factor. We found that the hybrid species overlaps in a similar way with both parental species while still having its own niche identity. This result may be explained by the fact that hybrid species inherit characteristics of two ecologically divergent species, which can result in intermediate or even transgressive phenotypes. These results support recent work on the role of hybridization in diversification.","uuid":"4f627e1c-ea03-3fdc-9262-b8e349462054","authors":[{"forename":"Gabriel C.","surname":"Costa"},{"forename":"Ingo","surname":"Schlupp"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Costa"},{"id":"6016476294","title":"Ecological niche modeling and geographical distribution of pollinator and plants: A case study of Peponapis fervens (Smith, 1879) (Eucerini: Apidae) and Cucurbita species (Cucurbitaceae)","type":"Journal Article","volume":"5","issue":"1","url":"http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/B7W63-4XC41S7-3\/2\/4e85db00225e91d2ac4296d0bacefade\nhttp:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S1574954109000752","tags":["2010","agriculture","BR","Brazil","GBIF_used","niche_modeling","SDM","species distribution","university"],"keywords":["Crops","Interacting species","openModeller","Potential distribution","Squash bee"],"pages":"59-66","year":"2010","abstract":"The bees of the Peponapis genus (Eucerini, Apidae) have a Neotropical distribution with the center of species diversity located in Mexico and are specialized in Cucurbita plants, which have many species of economic importance, such as squashes and pumpkins.

Bayesian analysis resulted in a trichotomy with three major groups: (1) The C. missioneira species group (C. celidochilus, C. empheres, C. minuano, C. missioneira, C. tendybaguassu, and an undescribed species analyzed); (2) a group of southern species (C. iguassuensis, C. punctata, C. scottii, C. vittata); and (3) a rather heterogeneous group comprising the type species C. macrophthalma, members of the Crenicichla reticulata species group (C. geayi, C. semifasciata), members of the Crenicichla wallacii species group (C. compressiceps, C. notophthalmus, C. regani, C. cf. regani), members of the Crenicichla saxatilis species group (C. lepidota, C. menezesi, C. sveni, C. sp.), and two species of Teleocichla. Parsimony jackknifing resulted in a quadritomy with: (1) C. macrophthalma, (2) Teleocichla, (3) the saxatilis + wallacii group species, and (4) the rest, which include C. geayi and C. semifasciata as sister group to a dichotomy with the C. missioneira group and the remaining southern species. The sequence variation within the C. missioneira group is remarkably minor despite considerable morphological differences, supporting the conclusion that it forms an endemic species flock in the Uruguay River basin. Previously proposed species groups within the speciose genus Crenicichla (more than 90 species known) are partly corroborated. However, C. celidochilus was not previously associated with the C. missioneira species group, and C. vittata has not previously been associated with C. scottii, C. iguassuensis, or C. punctata. Crenicichla lepidota, C. sveni, C. menezesi and C. sp. represent the C. saxatilis group. Species of small size, representing the C. wallacii species group and Teleocichla are characterized by very long branches, and the position of Teleocichla differed considerably between the Bayesian and parsimony trees. This finding does not invalidate Teleocichla but rather suggests that the several monophyletic major clades within Crenicichla may need nominal recognition. A putative hybrid specimen with a morphology combining components from C. vittata and C. scottii, but with a cytochrome b sequence from C. scottii was found in a sample from the Rio Quara\u00ed\/Cuareim. Another putative hybrid specimen with a unique morphology but a cytochrome b sequence agreeing with C. scottii was found in a sample from Maldonado, but no other Crenicichla species than C. scottii is known from that locality. Zusammenfassung Eine phylogenetische Analyse mit Hilfe von Bayesianischer Inferenz, Likelihood und Parsimonie-Methoden wurde an Hand von 60 kompletten mitochondrialen Cytochrome b-Sequenzen von 21 Arten von Crenicichla durchgef\u00fchrt, die alle Arten aus Uruguay (C. celidochilus, C. lepidota C. minuano, C. missioneira, C. punctata, C. scottii, C. vittata,), au\u00dferdem C. compressiceps, C. empheres, C. geayi, C. iguassuensis, C. macrophthalma, C. menezesi, C. notophthalmus, C. regani, C. cf. regani, C. semifasciata, C. sveni, C. tendybaguassu, sowie zwei nicht identifizierte Arten und zwei Arten der Gattung Teleocichla umfassen. Die Bayesianische Analyse ergab eine Trichotomie mit drei Gruppen: (1) Die C. missioneira- Artengruppe (C. celidochilus, C. empheres, C. minuano, C. missioneira, C. tendybaguassu, und eine noch unbeschriebene Art; (2) eine Gruppe von im S\u00fcden verbreiteten Arten (C. iguassuensis, C. punctata, C. scottii, C. vittata), und (3) eine recht heterogene Gruppe, die die Typusart C. macrophthalma, Mitglieder der C. reticulata Artengruppe (C. geayi, C. semifasciata), Mitglieder der C. wallacii- Artengruppe (C. compressiceps, C. notophthalmus, C. regani, C. cf. regani), Mitglieder der C. saxatilis-Artengruppe (C. lepidota, C. menezesi, C. sveni, C. sp.), sowie die zwei Teleocichla-Arten beinhaltete. Die Parsimonie-Analyse mit Anwendung von Jackknifing erbrachte eine Quadritomie mit (1) C. macrophthalma, (2) Teleocichla, (3) den Arten der saxatilis + wallacii-Artengruppen, und (4) dem Rest, der C. geayi and C. semifasciata enthielt, die als Schwestergruppe zur C. missioneira-Artengruppe plus den \u00fcbrigen im S\u00fcden verbreiteten Arten errechnet wurde. Die Variation in der DNA-Sequenz innerhalb der C. missioneira-Artengruppe ist erstaunlich niedrig trotz doch recht betr\u00e4chtlicher morphologischer Unterschiede, was die Hypothese unterst\u00fctzt, dass es sich um einen endemischen Artenschwarm des Uruguay-Flusses handelt. Crenicichla celidochilus war bisher nicht mit der C. missioneira-Artengruppe in Verbindung gebracht worden. Ebenso war man bisher nicht von einer n\u00e4heren Verwandtschaft von Crenicichla vittata zu den Arten C. scottii, C. iguassuensis oder C. punctata ausgegangen. Bisher vorgeschlagene Artengruppen innerhalb der artenreichen Gattung Crenicichla (mit mehr als 90 Arten) wurden teilweise best\u00e4tigt. Crenicichla lepidota, C. sveni, C. menezesi und C. sp. geh\u00f6ren zur C. saxatilis-Artengruppe. Die kleinw\u00fcchsigen Arten, die die C. wallacii-Artengruppe repr\u00e4sentieren, sowie auch Teleocichla waren durch lange \u00c4ste gekennzeichnet, wobei sich die Stellung von Teleocichla in den beiden Stammb\u00e4umen, die durch Bayesianische oder Parsimonie-Analysen erzielt wurden, stark unterschied. Dies hei\u00dft nicht, dass Teleocichla keine g\u00fcltige Gattung darstellt, sondern dass mehrere monophyletische Gruppen innerhalb von Crenicichla einen wissenschaftlichen Namen bekommen sollten. Cytochrom b besitzt offenbar nicht das n\u00f6tige Aufl\u00f6sungspotential, um die Verwandtschaftsverh\u00e4ltnisse zwischen den gr\u00f6\u00dferen Gruppen zu kl\u00e4ren. Ein m\u00f6gliches Hybridexemplar mit einer Mischung von morphologischen Merkmalen von C. vittata wie auch C. scottii, jedoch mit der Cytochrom b-Sequenz von C. scottii befand sich unter den Exemplaren, die im Rio Quara\u00ed\/Cuareim gesammelt worden waren. Ein weiteres m\u00f6gliches Hybridtier mit einzigartigen morphologischen Merkmalen, aber einer Cytochrom b-Sequenz, die mit der von C. scottii\u00fcbereinstimmte, befand sich unter den Exemplaren von Maldonado, obwohl von dort bis auf C. scottii keine weitere Crenicichla-Art bekannt ist.","uuid":"11f000e5-bec6-3ee6-857a-1fed470e38fa","authors":[{"forename":"Sven O.","surname":"Kullander"},{"forename":"Michael","surname":"Nor\u00e9n"},{"forename":"Georg B.","surname":"Fri\u00f0riksson"},{"forename":"Carlos A.","surname":"Santos de Lucena"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Journal of Zoological Systematics and Evolutionary Research","firstAuthor":"Kullander"},{"id":"6016477134","title":"Predicting the distributions of marine organisms at the global scale","type":"Journal Article","volume":"221","issue":"3","url":"http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/B6VBS-4XSCVHM-1\/2\/c8c322a135ca495968b2e0ae2d2b1a4c","tags":["2010","AU","Australia","BR","Brazil","DE","GB","GBIF_used","Germany","marine","niche_modeling","PH","Philippines","research institute","SDM","SE","Sweden","university"],"notes":"GBIF data was most likely used but it isn&#039;t explicitely stated.","keywords":["Expert review","Global marine biodiversity","Model comparison","Range maps","Species distribution modelling","Trawl surveys"],"pages":"467-478","year":"2010","abstract":"We present and evaluate AquaMaps, a presence-only species distribution modelling system that allows the incorporation of expert knowledge about habitat usage and was designed for maximum output of standardized species range maps at the global scale. In the marine environment there is a significant challenge to the production of range maps due to large biases in the amount and location of occurrence data for most species. AquaMaps is compared with traditional presence-only species distribution modelling methods to determine the quality of outputs under equivalently automated conditions. The effect of the inclusion of expert knowledge to AquaMaps is also investigated. Model outputs were tested internally, through data partitioning, and externally against independent survey data to determine the ability of models to predict presence versus absence. Models were also tested externally by assessing correlation with independent survey estimates of relative species abundance. AquaMaps outputs compare well to the existing methods tested, and inclusion of expert knowledge results in a general improvement in model outputs. The transparency, speed and adaptability of the AquaMaps system, as well as the existing online framework which allows expert review to compensate for sampling biases and thus improve model predictions are proposed as additional benefits for public and research use alike.","uuid":"2ad27883-c831-379f-a779-5fa959a01b00","authors":[{"forename":"Jonathan","surname":"Ready"},{"forename":"Kristin","surname":"Kaschner"},{"forename":"Andy B.","surname":"South"},{"forename":"Paul D.","surname":"Eastwood"},{"forename":"Tony","surname":"Rees"},{"forename":"Josephine","surname":"Rius"},{"forename":"Eli","surname":"Agbayani"},{"forename":"Sven O.","surname":"Kullander"},{"forename":"Rainer","surname":"Froese"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Ecological Modelling","firstAuthor":"Ready"}]
