The method involves the creation of current distribution maps, analysis of threat factors and use of the RAMAS Red List software to facilitate rapid and objective classification of taxa in accordance with 2001 IUCN criteria. In order to ensure a more objective approach by the assessor and reduce the range of uncertainty, an index was created for calculating Risk Tolerance (RT) that enabled adjustment of the results obtained and thus supplemented the software used. For trial purposes, the proposed model was applied to Spanish gypsophilous flora currently protected under Spanish regional legislation. When classified using the new model, the taxa in question were placed in very different categories, ranging from least concern (LC) to endangered (EN), indicating the need to redefine both their current legal status and recommended management measures. Use of this method will enable scientists to optimise available information on the geographical distribution of endangered taxa, and help governments both to optimise their financial investment in conservation and to define their priorities. The authors endorse the use of IUCN categories in legal protection texts, and advocate as essential a greater degree of coordination between scientists and governments.","uuid":"91a08a05-1db5-3e6b-8859-03847af448ca","authors":[{"forename":"Raquel","surname":"Alonso-Redondo"},{"forename":"Elena","surname":"De Paz"},{"forename":"Eduardo","surname":"Alonso-Herrero"},{"forename":"Marta-Eva","surname":"Garc\u00eda-Gonz\u00e1lez"},{"forename":"Estrella","surname":"Alfaro-Saiz"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Journal for Nature Conservation","firstAuthor":"Alonso-Redondo"},{"id":"6016483614","title":"Habitat-specific larval dispersal and marine connectivity: implications for spatial conservation planning","type":"Journal Article","volume":"4","issue":"7","url":"http:\/\/www.esajournals.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1890\/ES13-00119.1","tags":["2013","Aichi_E","conservation","ES","GBIF_primary","GBIF_used","GBIF_VIP","GBits_9","marine","Spain","Target_19","US","USA_biodiversity"],"keywords":["graph theory","Gulf of California","larval dispersal","marine connectivity","Marine Life Protection Act","marine protected areas networks","rules of thumb","spacing rules"],"pages":"art82","year":"2013","abstract":"Connectivity via larval dispersal is an important ingredient in setting effective marine reserve networks. Simple guidance for establishing spacing between individual protected sites can provide reliable rules of thumb to help ensure connectivity. Spacing rules for protected network design are relatively new to marine spatial planning, though so far they have been generically and indiscriminately applied to all types of habitats based on a single range of distance values. Here we address the extent to which such rules capture subtleties associated with dispersal distances varying among species in different regions and habitats. We applied a 50\u2013100 km global spacing rule (SRglob), also recently applied in the California Marine Life Protection Act (MLPA) process and based on available global larval dispersal data, to a previously assessed network in the Gulf of California. Using larval dispersal data for species within this region (SRreg), we associated each species with eight unique habitats (SRhab*) and we evaluated connectivity by means of different spacing rules (SRglob, SRreg and SRhab*) using graph-theory. The existing spacing rule employed by the MLPA process (SRglob) was found to be robust and conservative when applied to the Gulf of California or to its different habitats (i.e., the lower limit for dispersal distance includes the distance for all species in the Gulf). We found that species in different habitats exhibit statistically distinct dispersal profiles. Therefore, some habitats could be evaluated with more relaxed spacing rules (i.e., larger distances), than those proposed by the rules of thumb. Our work identifies a conservation planning trade-off when implementing spacing rules: already proposed rules are robust but at the cost of efficiency. Habitat-specific spacing rules should be considered for more efficient marine conservation planning solutions.","uuid":"cd912217-5cc0-3eb4-80aa-7e189d606ed1","authors":[{"forename":"Jos\u00e9 D.","surname":"Anad\u00f3n"},{"forename":"Maria","surname":"del Mar Mancha-Cisneros"},{"forename":"Benjamin D.","surname":"Best"},{"forename":"Leah R.","surname":"Gerber"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Ecosphere","firstAuthor":"Anad\u00f3n"},{"id":"6016484314","title":"Conservation status of the narrow endemic gypsophile Ononis tridentata subsp. crassifolia in southern Spain: effects of habitat disturbance","type":"Journal Article","volume":"47","issue":"02","url":"http:\/\/www.journals.cambridge.org\/abstract_S0030605312001688","tags":["2013","Aichi_C","conservation","ES","GBIF_used","GBits_8","plants","Spain","Spain_biodiversity","Target_12"],"keywords":["Conservation status","grazing","gypsophile","gypsum quarrying","habitat disturbance","narrow endemic","Ononis tridentata","ploughing"],"pages":"199-202","year":"2013","abstract":"Ononis tridentata L. subsp. crassifolia (Leguminosae) is a narrow endemic plant restricted to gypsum outcrops in south-east Spain.

The stacking of species-distribution models (S-SDMs) is receiving attention by conservation researchers because this approach is capable of simultaneously predicting species richness and composition.

We designed two indicators of predictive performance that were based on the diversity factors used to measure species turnover: a (shared species between the observed and predicted compositions), b and c (the exclusive species of the predicted and observed compositions respectively) and compared them with the Sorensen andBeta-Simpson turnovermeasures. 3.

The Sahara is the largest warm desert in the world and together with the arid Sahel displays high topographical and climatic heterogeneity, and has experienced recent and strong climatic oscillations that have greatly shifted biodiversity distribution and community composition. The large size, remoteness and long-term political instability of the Sahara-Sahel, have limited knowledge on its biodiversity. However, over the last decade, there have been an increasing number of published scientific studies based on modern geomatic and molecular tools, and broad sampling of taxa of these regions. This review tracks trends in knowledge about biodiversity patterns, processes and threats across the Sahara-Sahel, and anticipates needs for biodiversity research and conservation. Recent studies are changing completely the perception of regional biodiversity patterns. Instead of relatively low species diversity with distribution covering most of the region, studies now suggest a high rate of endemism and larger number of species, with much narrower and fragmented ranges, frequently limited to micro-hotspots of biodiversity. Molecular-based studies are also unravelling cryptic diversity associated with mountains, which together with recent distribution atlases, allows identifying integrative biogeographic patterns in biodiversity distribution. Mapping of multivariate environmental variation (at 1 km \u00d7 1 km resolution) of the region illustrates main biogeographical features of the Sahara-Sahel and supports recently hypothesised dispersal corridors and refugia. Micro-scale water-features present mostly in mountains have been associated with local biodiversity hotspots. However, the distribution of available data on vertebrates highlights current knowledge gaps that still apply to a large proportion of the Sahara-Sahel. Current research is providing insights into key evolutionary and ecological processes, including causes and timing of radiation and divergence for multiple taxa, and associating the onset of the Sahara with diversification processes for low-mobility vertebrates. Examples of phylogeographic patterns are showing the importance of allopatric speciation in the Sahara-Sahel, and this review presents a synthetic overview of the most commonly hypothesised diversification mechanisms. Studies are also stressing that biodiversity is threatened by increasing human activities in the region, including overhunting and natural resources prospection, and in the future by predicted global warming. A representation of areas of conflict, landmines, and natural resources extraction illustrates how human activities and regional insecurity are hampering biodiversity research and conservation. Although there are still numerous knowledge gaps for the optimised conservation of biodiversity in the region, a set of research priorities is provided to identify the framework data needed to support regional conservation planning.","uuid":"a3ae4f28-7b82-3b17-9f9f-bce9bf181d8d","authors":[{"forename":"Jos\u00e9 C.","surname":"Brito"},{"forename":"Raquel","surname":"Godinho"},{"forename":"Fernando","surname":"Mart\u00ednez-Freir\u00eda"},{"forename":"Juan M.","surname":"Pleguezuelos"},{"forename":"Hugo","surname":"Rebelo"},{"forename":"Xavier","surname":"Santos"},{"forename":"C\u00e2ndida G.","surname":"Vale"},{"forename":"Guillermo","surname":"Velo-Ant\u00f3n"},{"forename":"Zbyszek","surname":"Boraty\u0144ski"},{"forename":"S\u00edlvia B.","surname":"Carvalho"},{"forename":"S\u00f3nia","surname":"Ferreira"},{"forename":"Duarte V.","surname":"Gon\u00e7alves"},{"forename":"Teresa L.","surname":"Silva"},{"forename":"Pedro","surname":"Tarroso"},{"forename":"Jo\u00e3o C.","surname":"Campos"},{"forename":"Jo\u00e3o V.","surname":"Leite"},{"forename":"Joana","surname":"Nogueira"},{"forename":"Francisco","surname":"Alvares"},{"forename":"Neftal\u00ed","surname":"Sillero"},{"forename":"Andack S.","surname":"Sow"},{"forename":"Soumia","surname":"Fahd"},{"forename":"Pierre-Andr\u00e9","surname":"Crochet"},{"forename":"Salvador","surname":"Carranza"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Biological reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society","firstAuthor":"Brito"},{"id":"6075602054","title":"First record of a gecko species to the fauna of Qatar: Hemidactylus persicus Anderson, 1872 (Gekkonidae)","type":"Journal Article","volume":"1872","url":"http:\/\/www.qscience.com\/doi\/abs\/10.5339\/connect.2013.28","tags":["2013","Aichi_E","EG","Egypt","ES","GBIF_used","GBits_10","QA","Qatar","RO","Romania","Spain","Target_19","taxonomy"],"keywords":[],"year":"2013","abstract":"We report the discovery of a gecko species, the Persian leaf-toed gecko Hemidactylus persicus Anderson, 1872 (Gekkonidae) in Qatar, found on Halul Island.

Here we present new data on bryozoan species and their spatial distribution in the Argentine Patagonian (AP) region, as well as an analysis of the bryozoological similarities between deep ranges from Argentina and neighbouring regions. A total of 108 species of cheilostome bryozoans (378 samples), belonging to 59 genera was found.

The bryozoological affinities found in the current study between the nearest geographical neighbours are in agreement with the hypothesis of the sequential separation of Gondwana during the Cenozoic. Moreover, a high number of shared species, mainly from the slope, were found in this study between the AP region and Antarctica, thus supporting the idea that the Southern Ocean may have been less isolated over geological time than once thought.","uuid":"55508308-1753-3858-b15a-ade027d5bad0","authors":[{"forename":"Blanca","surname":"Figuerola"},{"forename":"Dennis P.","surname":"Gordon"},{"forename":"Virginia","surname":"Polonio"},{"forename":"Javier","surname":"Cristobo"},{"forename":"Conxita","surname":"Avila"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Figuerola"},{"id":"6016483344","title":"Content assessment of the primary biodiversity data Published through gbif network: status, challenges and potentials","type":"Journal Article","volume":"8","issue":"August 2012","url":"https:\/\/journals.ku.edu\/index.php\/jbi\/article\/view\/4124","tags":["2013","Denmark","DK","ES","GBIF_author","GBIF_used","GBIF_VIP","GBits_9","Global_biodiversity","informatics","Spain"],"keywords":["content assessment","gap analysis","primary biodiversity data"],"pages":"94-172","year":"2013","abstract":"With the establishment of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) in 2001 as an inter-governmental coordinating body, concerted efforts have been made during the past decade to establish a global research infrastructure to facilitate the publishing, discovery, and access to primary biodiversity data.

Since prevention is the most cost-effective way to avoid biodiversity loss and ecosystem problems, one challenge in ecological research is to understand the limits of the fundamental niche of the species in order to estimate how far invasive species could spread. Trichocorixa verticalis verticalis (Tvv) is a corixid (Hemiptera) originally distributed in North America, but cited as an alien species in three continents. Its impact on native communities is under study, but it is already the dominant species in several saline wetlands and represents a rare example of an aquatic alien insect. This study aims: i) to estimate areas with suitable environmental conditions for Tvv at a global scale, thus identifying potential new zones of invasion; and ii) to test possible changes in this global potential distribution under a climate change scenario. Potential distributions were estimated by applying a multidimensional envelope procedure based on both climatic data, obtained from observed occurrences, and thermal physiological data. Our results suggest Tvv may expand well beyond its current range and find inhabitable conditions in temperate areas along a wide range of latitudes, with an emphasis on coastal areas of Europe, Northern Africa, Argentina, Uruguay, Australia, New Zealand, Myanmar, India, the western boundary between USA and Canada, and areas of the Arabian Peninsula. When considering a future climatic scenario, the suitability area of Tvv showed only limited changes compared with the current potential distribution. These results allow detection of potential contact zones among currently colonized areas and potential areas of invasion. We also identified zones with a high level of suitability that overlap with areas recognized as global hotspots of biodiversity. Finally, we present hypotheses about possible means of spread, focusing on different geographical scales.","uuid":"74c6b38e-860e-353b-ba0a-b2921ed31e62","authors":[{"forename":"Simone","surname":"Guareschi"},{"forename":"Cristina","surname":"Coccia"},{"forename":"David","surname":"S\u00e1nchez-Fern\u00e1ndez"},{"forename":"Jos\u00e9 Antonio","surname":"Carbonell"},{"forename":"Josefa","surname":"Velasco"},{"forename":"Luz","surname":"Boyero"},{"forename":"Andy J.","surname":"Green"},{"forename":"Andr\u00e9s","surname":"Mill\u00e1n"}],"editors":[{"forename":"Matteo","surname":"Convertino"}],"publication_outlet":"PLoS ONE","firstAuthor":"Guareschi"},{"id":"6016481294","title":"Phylogeography and postglacial expansion of the endangered semi-aquatic mammal Galemys pyrenaicus","type":"Journal Article","volume":"13","issue":"1","url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2148\/13\/115","tags":["2013","Aichi_C","conservation","ES","GB","GBIF_used","GBits_9","Maxent","SDM","Spain","Spain_biodiversity","Target_12"],"keywords":[],"pages":"115","year":"2013","abstract":"Species with strict ecological requirements may provide new insights into the forces that shaped the geographic variation of genetic diversity. The Pyrenean desman, Galemys pyrenaicus, is a small semi-aquatic mammal that inhabits clean streams of the northern half of the Iberian Peninsula and is endangered in most of its geographic range, but its genetic structure is currently unknown. While the stringent ecological demands derived from its aquatic habitat might have caused a partition of the genetic diversity among river basins, Pleistocene glaciations would have generated a genetic pattern related to glacial refugia. Results To study the relative importance of historical and ecological factors in the genetic structure of G. pyrenaicus, we used mitochondrial and intronic sequences of specimens covering most of the species range. We show, first, that the Pyrenean desman has very low levels of genetic diversity compared to other mammals. In addition, phylogenetic and dating analyses of the mitochondrial sequences reveal a strong phylogeographic structure of a Middle Pleistocene origin, suggesting that the main lineages arose during periods of glacial isolation. Furthermore, both the spatial distribution of nuclear and mitochondrial diversity and the results of species distribution modeling suggest the existence of a major glacial refugium in the northwestern part of the Iberian Peninsula. Finally, the main mitochondrial lineages show a striking parapatric distribution without any apparent exchange of mitochondrial haplotypes between the lineages that came into secondary contact (although with certain permeability to nuclear genes), indicating incomplete mixing after the post-glacial recolonization. On the other hand, when we analyzed the partition of the genetic diversity among river basins, the Pyrenean desman showed a lower than expected genetic differentiation among main rivers. Conclusions The analysis of mitochondrial and intronic markers in G. pyrenaicus showed the predominant effects of Pleistocene glaciations on the genetic structure of this species, while the distribution of the genetic diversity was not greatly influenced by the main river systems. These results and, particularly, the discovery of a marked phylogeographic structure, may have important implications for the conservation of the Pyrenean desman.","uuid":"2b087440-dfb6-37c1-96bb-db2d6cbe36a0","authors":[{"forename":"Javier","surname":"Igea"},{"forename":"Pere","surname":"Aymerich"},{"forename":"Angel","surname":"Fern\u00e1ndez-Gonz\u00e1lez"},{"forename":"Jorge","surname":"Gonz\u00e1lez-Esteban"},{"forename":"Asunci\u00f3n","surname":"G\u00f3mez"},{"forename":"Roc\u00edo","surname":"Alonso"},{"forename":"Joaquim","surname":"Gos\u00e1lbez"},{"forename":"Jose","surname":"Castresana"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"BMC evolutionary biology","firstAuthor":"Igea"},{"id":"6016484434","title":"Local representation of global diversity in a cosmopolitan lichen-forming fungal species complex ( Rhizoplaca , Ascomycota)","type":"Journal Article","url":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/jbi.12118","tags":["2013","Aichi_E","CZ","Czech Republic","DE","ES","GBIF_used","GBits_8","Germany","global_biodiversity","in_press","IR","Iran","Spain","Target_19","US"],"keywords":["beast","biogeography","bpp","coalescent","correspondence","cryptic species","leavitt","long-distance dispersal","rhizoplaca melanophthalma","speciation"],"year":"2013","abstract":"Aim The relative importance of long-distance dispersal versus vicariance in determining the distribution of lichen-forming fungi remains unresolved. Here, we examined diversity and distributions in a cosmopolitan lichen-forming fungal species complex, Rhizoplaca melanophthalma sensu lato (Ascomycota), across a broad, intercontinental geographical distribution. We sought to determine the temporal context of diversification and the impacts of past climatic fluctuations on demographic dynamics within this group. Location Antarctica, Asia, Europe, North America and South America. Methods We obtained molecular sequence data from a total of 240 specimens of R. melanophthalma s.l. collected across five continents. We assessed the monophyly of candidate species using individual gene trees and a tree from a seven-locus concatenated data set. Divergence times and relationships among candidate species were evaluated using a multilocus coalescent-based species tree approach. Speciation probabilities were estimated using the coalescent-based species delimitation program bpp. We also calculated statistics on molecular diversity and population demographics for independent lineages. Main conclusions Our analyses of R. melanophthalma s.l. collected from five continents supported the presence of six species-level lineages within this complex. Based on current sampling, two of these lineages were found to have broad intercontinental distributions, while the other four were limited to western North America. Of the six lineages, five were found on a single mountain in the western USA and the sixth occurred no more than 200 km away from this mountain. Our estimates of divergence times suggest that Pleistocene glacial cycles played an important role in species diversification within this group. At least three lineages show evidence of recent or ongoing population expansion.","uuid":"6610eea7-a571-3787-bfdd-2ebc3935d20f","authors":[{"forename":"Steven D.","surname":"Leavitt"},{"forename":"Fernando","surname":"Fern\u00e1ndez-Mendoza"},{"forename":"Sergio","surname":"P\u00e9rez-Ortega"},{"forename":"Mohammad","surname":"Sohrabi"},{"forename":"Pradeep K.","surname":"Divakar"},{"forename":"Jan","surname":"Vondr\u00e1k"},{"forename":"H.","surname":"Thorsten Lumbsch"},{"forename":"Larry L.

Previous research suggested that environmental forcing results in highly congruent regionalization patterns across taxa, but that the size and number of regions depends on the dispersal ability of the taxa considered. We produced a biogeographic regionalization of European bryophytes and hypothesized that (1) regions defined for bryophytes would differ from those defined for other taxa due to the highly specific eco-physiology of the group and (2) their high dispersal ability would result in the resolution of few, large regions. Species distributions were recorded using 10,000 km(2) MGRS pixels. Because of the lack of data across large portions of the area, species distribution models employing macroclimatic variables as predictors were used to determine the potential composition of empty pixels. K-means clustering analyses of the pixels based on their potential species composition were employed to define biogeographic regions. The optimal number of regions was determined by v-fold cross-validation and Moran's I statistic. The spatial congruence of the regions identified from their potential bryophyte assemblages with large-scale vegetation patterns is at odds with our primary hypothesis. This reinforces the notion that post-glacial migration patterns might have been much more similar in bryophytes and vascular plants than previously thought. The substantially lower optimal number of clusters and the absence of nested patterns within the main biogeographic regions, as compared to identical analyses in vascular plants, support our second hypothesis. The modelling approach implemented here is, however, based on many assumptions that are discussed but can only be tested when additional data on species distributions become available, highlighting the substantial importance of developing integrated mapping projects for all taxa in key biogeographically areas of Europe, and the Mediterranean peninsulas in particular.","uuid":"f5d9cd9a-28ca-3ce8-a7df-8c25b38f2f61","authors":[{"forename":"Rub\u00e9n G.","surname":"Mateo"},{"forename":"Alain","surname":"Vanderpoorten"},{"forename":"Jes\u00fas","surname":"Mu\u00f1oz"},{"forename":"Benjamin","surname":"Laenen"},{"forename":"Aur\u00e9lie","surname":"D\u00e9samor\u00e9"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Mateo"},{"id":"6181069334","title":"Harvestmen of the BOS Arthropod Collection of the University of Oviedo (Spain) (Arachnida, Opiliones)","type":"Journal Article","volume":"341","url":"http:\/\/www.pensoft.net\/journals\/zookeys\/article\/6130\/abstract\/harvestmen-of-the-bos-arthropod-collection-of-the-university-of-oviedo-spain-arachnida-opiliones-","tags":["2013","Aichi_E","datapaper","ecology","ES","GBIF_used","GBits_11","Portugal_biodiversity","Spain","Spain_biodiversity","Target_19","taxonomy"],"keywords":[],"pages":"21-36","year":"2013","abstract":"There are significant gaps in accessible knowledge about the distribution and phenology of Iberian harvestmen (Arachnida: Opiliones).

Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) of the different ecoregions of Andalusia and northern Morocco were conducted to determine their floristic affinities.

Based on tissue or saliva samples of over 1000 individuals, we compare a variety of genetic marker systems, including mitochondrial DNA, single-copy protein-coding nuclear genes, microsatellite loci, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of transcriptomes of both species. The two focal species differ radically in their phylogeographic structure, with R. temporaria being strongly variable among and within populations, and R. dalmatina homogeneous across Europe with a single strongly differentiated population in southern Italy. These differences were observed across the various markers studied, including microsatellites and SNP density, but especially in protein-coding nuclear genes where R. dalmatina had extremely low heterozygosity values across its range, including potential refugial areas, whereas R. temporaria had comparably high range-wide values, including many areas of probable postglacial colonization. A phylogeny of R. temporaria based on various concatenated mtDNA genes revealed that two haplotype clades endemic to Iberia form a paraphyletic group at the base of the cladogram, and all other haplotypes form a monophyletic group, in agreement with an Iberian origin of the species. Demographic analysis suggests that R. temporaria and R. dalmatina have genealogies of roughly the same time to coalescence (TMRCA \u223c3.5 mya for both species), but R. temporaria might have been been characterized by larger ancestral and current effective population sizes than R. dalmatina. The unusually high genetic variation in R. temporaria can therefore be explained by its early range expansion out of Iberia, with subsequent cycles of differentiation in cryptic glacial refugial areas followed by admixture, while the range expansion of R. dalmatina into central Europe is a more recent event.","uuid":"b330f971-716c-3e23-9946-69d5abe1d745","authors":[{"forename":"Miguel","surname":"Vences"},{"forename":"J","surname":"Susanne Hauswaldt"},{"forename":"Sebastian","surname":"Steinfartz"},{"forename":"Oliver","surname":"Rupp"},{"forename":"Alexander","surname":"Goesmann"},{"forename":"Sven","surname":"K\u00fcnzel"},{"forename":"Pablo","surname":"Orozco-Terwengel"},{"forename":"David R","surname":"Vieites"},{"forename":"Sandra","surname":"Nieto-Roman"},{"forename":"Sabrina","surname":"Haas"},{"forename":"Clara","surname":"Laugsch"},{"forename":"Marcelo","surname":"Gehara"},{"forename":"Sebastian","surname":"Bruchmann"},{"forename":"Maciej","surname":"Pabijan"},{"forename":"Ann-Kathrin","surname":"Ludewig"},{"forename":"Dirk","surname":"Rudert"},{"forename":"Claudio","surname":"Angelini"},{"forename":"Leo J.","surname":"Borkin"},{"forename":"Pierre-Andr\u00e9","surname":"Crochet"},{"forename":"Angelica","surname":"Crottini"},{"forename":"Alain","surname":"Dubois"},{"forename":"G.","surname":"Francesco Ficetola"},{"forename":"Pedro","surname":"Gal\u00e1n"},{"forename":"Philippe","surname":"Geniez"},{"forename":"Monika","surname":"Hachtel"},{"forename":"Olga","surname":"Jovanovic"},{"forename":"Spartak N.","surname":"Litvinchuk"},{"forename":"Petros","surname":"Lymberakis"},{"forename":"Annemarie","surname":"Ohler"},{"forename":"Nazar A.","surname":"Smirnov"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Molecular phylogenetics and evolution","firstAuthor":"Vences"},{"id":"6016483284","title":"Primary Biodiversity Data Records in the Pyrenees","type":"Journal Article","volume":"11","issue":"6","url":"http:\/\/omicron.ch.tuiasi.ro\/EEMJ\/","tags":["2012","Aichi_E","ES","GBIF_used","informatics","Spain","Spain_biodiversity","Target_19"],"keywords":["biodiversity","data availability","digital assets pyrenees"],"pages":"1059-1075","year":"2012","abstract":"We characterize the primary biodiversity data records that have been made public for retrieval for the Pyrenean region.

Methods: We used boosted regression trees to evaluate the relative influence of, and relationship between, the invader's current pattern of distribution and a set of spatially explicit variables considered important to their colonization success. These variables are related to four well-known invasion hypotheses, namely the role of propagule pressure, climate matching, biotic resistance from known competitors, and human disturbance. Results: Model predictions attained a high accuracy for the two invaders (mean AUC \u2265 0.91). Propagule pressure and climatic suitability were identified as the primary drivers of colonization, but the former had a much higher relative influence on the red swamp crayfish. Climate matching was shown to have limited predictive value and climatic suitability models based on occurrences from other invaded areas had consistently higher relative explanatory power than models based on native range data. Biotic resistance and human disturbance were also shown to be weak predictors of the distribution of the two invaders.

Material: We listed vascular aquatic plant presence or absence for 44 countries. We also compiled total plant species richness and geographic and environmental variables for each country. Methods: We first analysed country ordination based on their aquatic flora constrained by environmental variables (dbRDA), and selected the environmental variables best explaining species patterns (BEST analysis). Total species richness patterns were studied using maps and latitudinal gradients. We used generalized additive models (GAM) to detect the main environmental factors driving species richness, both for aquatic plants and total plants. Results: The BEST analysis identified a single variable that best explains aquatic plant species distribution: evapotranspiration. However, richness of aquatic plants vs latitude varies and no clear trend was observed. No relation was found between total plant and aquatic plant richness. Aquatic and total plant richness peak between 40\u00b0 and 50\u00b0N, and values were intermediate at low latitudes. GAM related aquatic plant richness with water resources and rainfall, while total plant richness is mainly driven by evapotranspiration and temperature. Hydrophytes were relatively more abundant at higher latitudes than helophytes and the ratio correlated with evapotranspiration. Conclusion: Southern and western Europe hold the highest aquatic plant diversity, although no clear latitudinal species richness patterns were found. Aquatic plant richness is mainly driven by water-related variables. Total plant richness exhibits a latitudinal pattern influenced by the Sahara desert, which depresses richness at low latitudes. Best predictors of total plant richness patterns are water\u2013energy variables.","uuid":"b7ca756a-eccd-30d1-8f7a-6121c2b5b315","authors":[{"forename":"Eglantine","surname":"Chappuis"},{"forename":"Enric","surname":"Ballesteros"},{"forename":"Esperan\u00e7a","surname":"Gacia"}],"editors":[{"forename":"Hans Henrik","surname":"Bruun"}],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Chappuis"},{"id":"6016482634","title":"The Iberian endemic species Ranunculus cabrerensis Rothm.: an intricate history in the Ranunculus parnassiifolius L. polyploid complex","type":"Journal Article","volume":"298","issue":"1","url":"http:\/\/www.springerlink.com\/index\/10.1007\/s00606-011-0529-9","tags":["2012","conservation","ES","Europe_biodiversity","GBIF_used","Spain","taxonomy"],"keywords":["cpDNA network","genome size","Iberian Peninsula","polyploidy","Ranunculaceae","taxonomy"],"pages":"121-138","year":"2012","abstract":"The orophilous plant, Ranunculus parnassiifolius L., is a polyploid complex that is widespread throughout the southern European mountains, where at least five taxa have traditionally been recognized.

Using an ensemble of bioclimatic envelope models (BEMs), we modelled the climatic suitability of 191 stream macroinvertebrate species from 12 orders across Europe under two climate change scenarios for 2080 on a spatial resolution of 5 arc minutes. Analyses included assessments of relative changes in species\u2019 climatically suitable areas as well as their potential shifts in latitude and longitude with respect to species\u2019 thermal preferences. Climate-change effects were also analysed regarding species\u2019 ecological and biological groupings, namely 1) endemicity and 2) rarity within European ecoregions, 3) life cycle, 4) stream zonation preference and 5) current preference. The BEMs projected that suitable climate conditions would persist in Europe in the year 2080 for nearly 99% of the modelled species regardless of the climate scenario. Nevertheless, a decrease in the amount of climatically suitable areas was projected for 57-59% of the species. Depending on the scenario, losses could be of 38-44% on average. The suitable areas for species were projected to shift, on average, 4.7-6.6\u00b0 north and 3.9-5.4\u00b0 east. Cold-adapted species were projected to lose climatically suitable areas, while gains were expected for warm-adapted species. When projections were analysed for different species groupings, only endemics stood out as a particular group. That is, endemics were projected to lose significantly larger amounts of suitable climatic areas than non-endemic species. Despite the uncertainties involved in modelling exercises such as this, the extent of projected distributional changes reveals further the vulnerability of freshwater organisms to climate change and implies a need to understand the consequences for ecological function and biodiversity conservation.","uuid":"fd4fad1c-fac2-3096-98eb-1f2f8836d864","authors":[{"forename":"Sami","surname":"Domisch"},{"forename":"Miguel Bastos","surname":"Ara\u00fajo"},{"forename":"N\u00faria","surname":"Bonada"},{"forename":"Steffen U.","surname":"Pauls"},{"forename":"Sonja C.","surname":"J\u00e4hnig"},{"forename":"Peter","surname":"Haase"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Domisch"},{"id":"6016482254","title":"How plant inventories improve future monitoring","type":"Journal Article","volume":"online","url":"http:\/\/www.springerlink.com\/index\/10.1007\/s10531-012-0286-2","tags":["2012","conservation","ES","GBIF_used","South Africa","South Africa_biodiversity","Spain","Spain_biodiversity","US","USA_biodiversity","ZA"],"keywords":["Categories of threat","Hollow curve","Lognormal distribution","Mediterranean plant conservation","Rarity","Sample size","Skewness","Threatened plants"],"year":"2012","abstract":"Plant inventories are at the heart of conservation efforts. Despite their obvious conservation values, properties of these datasets are poorly understood. We use plant databases from three different well-established inventories [rare plants in California (CA), Spanish threatened plants (SP) and the Proteaceae in South Africa (SA)] to explore the behavior of large data sets in facilitating the link between current field surveys and future standardized monitoring methods. We analyze area frequency curves of the species area size for each data set and for a series of extracted databases from each inventory. Our results show that all field surveys produced left-skewed frequency distributions. A lognormal distribution is better fitted by SA, followed by CA and finally by SP, which is least suited to a lognormal fit. Using the most threatened portion of the three floras, these general patterns still apply. Secondly, a minimum sample analysis indicates that precision increases according to sample size. Proportionally, CA data require less sampling effort than the Spanish pool and the latter require less than do SA in order to get a clear monitoring trend. Larger skewness values are related to inventories with wider scope. SA Proteas display the most skewed distribution. Skewness in California may be explained not only by the nature and scope of the inventory but also by the scale used for mapping. The Spanish database is also affected by surveyor bias towards the most endangered portion of the data set. Monitoring should take into account the original nature of each inventory. Particular inventory methods and scope may produce different outputs, constraining future monitoring programs. Key aspects are skewness and variation, and both combined could identify inventories in need of better data collection practices for more precise estimates of changes in biodiversity.","uuid":"4b8f0974-ad26-3d68-ac65-54c24758a8ac","authors":[{"forename":"F.","surname":"Dom\u00ednguez Lozano"},{"forename":"A.

Location Macaronesia, Mediterranean, Atlantic fringe of Europe. Methods Patterns of genetic diversity are described based on variation at two chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) loci and one nuclear DNA (nDNA) locus for 109 accessions across the entire distribution range of the species. Global patterns of genetic differentiation were investigated using principal coordinates analysis. Genetic differentiation between island and continental areas, estimations of pollen- and seed-mediated gene flow, and the presence of phylogeographical signal were assessed by means of Fst\/NST (continental scale) and Fij\/Nij (local scale). Extant and past distribution ranges of the species were inferred from niche modelling using layers describing present and Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) macroclimatic conditions. Results The Azores exhibited a significantly higher genetic diversity than the continent. The lowest levels of genetic differentiation were observed between the Azores and the western Mediterranean, and the diversity observed in the Azores resulted from at least two colonization waves. Within the Azores, kinship coefficients showed a significant and much steeper decrease with geographical distance in the cpDNA than in the nDNA. The distribution predicted by LGM models was markedly different from the current potential distribution, particularly in western Europe, where no suitable areas were predicted by LGM models, and along the Atlantic coast of the African continent, where LGM models predicted highly suitable climatic conditions. Main conclusions The higher diversity observed in Azorean than in continental populations is inconsistent with MacArthur and Wilson\u2019s equilibrium model and derived theoretical population genetic expectations. This inverted pattern may be the result of extinction on the continent coupled with multiple island colonization events and subsequent allopatric diversification and lineage hybridization in the Azores. The results highlight the role of allopatric diversification in explaining diversification on islands and suggest that this process has played a much more significant role in shaping Azorean biodiversity than previously thought.","uuid":"29778d10-33ff-3fe2-a049-6c1e6afc42ee","authors":[{"forename":"Aur\u00e9lie","surname":"D\u00e9samor\u00e9"},{"forename":"B.","surname":"Laenen"},{"forename":"Juana-Mar\u00eda","surname":"Gonz\u00e1lez-Mancebo"},{"forename":"R.","surname":"Ja\u00e9n Molina"},{"forename":"Nadia","surname":"Bystriakova"},{"forename":"E.","surname":"Martinez-Klimova"},{"forename":"M.

Interest in the preservation of these habitats in Europe has increased over the last decades, but over this time there has been a general decline in habitat quality, affecting community structure, ecosystem functions and biodiversity. Negative drivers that trigger these changes include land-use changes (i.e. habitat destruction and fragmentation), pollution, climate change, natural succession and human management, as well as the presence of invasive exotic species. Scope Based on recent scientific literature, the effect of each of these potential drivers on a wide set of factors, including physiological traits, species richness and diversity, community structure, ecosystem functions and soil conditions, is reviewed. The effects of these drivers are generally understood, but the direction and magnitude of factor interactions, whenever studied, have shown high variability. Conclusions Habitat loss and fragmentation affect sensitive species and ecosystem functions. The nature of the surrounding area will condition the quality of the heathland remnants by, for example, propagule pressure from invasive species. The dominant ericoid shrubs can be out-competed by vigorous perennial grasses with increased atmospheric nitrogen deposition, although interactions with climate and management practices may either counteract or enhance this process. Grazing or periodic burning promotes heath loss but site-specific combined treatments maintain species diversity and community structure. Climate change alone moderately affects plant diversity, community structure and ecosystem functions. Combined with other factors, climatic changes will condition heath development, mainly with regard to key aspects such as seed set and seedling establishment, rare species occurrence and nutrient cycling in the soil. It is essential to address the effects of not only individual factors, but their interactions, together with land-use history, on heathland development and conservation in order to predict habitat response to future scenarios.","uuid":"060e93a8-c64f-3c4f-8b18-7be4f411b912","authors":[{"forename":"J.","surname":"Fag\u00fandez"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Annals of botany","firstAuthor":"Fag\u00fandez"},{"id":"6016483824","title":"Bauhinia forficata Link authenticity using flavonoids profile: Relation with their biological properties.","type":"Journal Article","volume":"134","issue":"2","url":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0308814612004165\nhttp:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23107705","tags":["2012","agriculture","Brazil_biodiversity","ES","GBIF_used","Portugal","PT","Spain","university"],"keywords":["Authenticity","B. forficata Link subsp. pruinosa (Vogel) Fortunat","Bauhinia forficata Link","Bioactivity","Flavonoids"],"pages":"894-904","year":"2012","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","abstract":"HPLC-DAD-ESI\/MS(n) was used to ascertain the authenticity of two certified and two commercial Bauhinia forficata Link samples.

First, it is hypothesized that the origin and development of the Central Asian Deserts generated a biogeographic barrier that fragmented past continuous distributions in Eastern and Western domains. Second, Pleistocene glaciations have been proposed as the main process driving the regional diversification within each of these domains. The European common toad and its closest relatives provide an interesting opportunity to examine the relative contributions of these paleogeographic and paleoclimatic events to the phylogeny and biogeography of a widespread Eurasiatic group. We investigate this issue by applying a multiproxy approach combining information from molecular phylogenies, a multiple correspondence analysis of allozyme data and species distribution models. Our study includes 304 specimens from 164 populations, covering most of the distributional range of the Bufo bufo species complex in the Western Palearctic. The phylogenies (ML and Bayesian analyses) were based on a total of 1988 bp of mitochondrial DNA encompassing three genes (tRNAval, 16S and ND1). A dataset with 173 species of the family Bufonidae was assembled to estimate the separation of the two pan-Eurasiatic species complexes of Bufo and to date the main biogeographic events within the Bufo bufo species complex. The allozyme study included sixteen protein systems, corresponding to 21 presumptive loci. Finally, the distribution models were based on maximum entropy. Our distribution models show that Eastern and Western species complexes are greatly isolated by the Central Asian Deserts, and our dating estimates place this divergence during the Middle Miocene, a moment in which different sources of evidence document a major upturn of the aridification rate of Central Asia. This climate-driven process likely separated the Eastern and Western species. At the level of the Western Palearctic, our dating estimates place most of the deepest phylogenetic structure before the Pleistocene, indicating that Pleistocene glaciations did not have a major role in splitting the major lineages. At a shallow level, the glacial dynamics contributed unevenly to the genetic structuring of populations, with a strong influence in the European-Caucasian populations, and a more relaxed effect in the Iberian populations.","uuid":"ed940d5e-18f9-36a6-afb1-e127807288cd","authors":[{"forename":"J.","surname":"Garcia-Porta"},{"forename":"S.

Second, we use causal modelling to analyse the potential influence of climatic factors (current and LGM niche suitability) and altitude in the observed patterns of genetic structure. We found that genetic diversity is negatively associated with local climatic stability since the LGM, which may be due to higher immigration rates in unstable patches during favourable climatic periods and\/or temporally varying selection. Analyses of spatial genetic structure revealed the presence of three main genetic clusters, a pattern that is mainly driven by two highly differentiated populations located in the northern edge of the species distribution range. After controlling for geographic distance, causal modelling analyses showed that genetic relatedness decreases with the environmental divergence among sampling sites estimated as altitude and current and LGM niche suitability. Natural selection against nonlocal genotypes and\/or asynchrony in reproductive phenology may explain this pattern. Overall, this study suggests that local environmental conditions can shape patterns of genetic structure and variability even in species with high potential for gene flow and relatively small distribution ranges.","uuid":"128e7d7b-f99d-3bab-8e6c-58d7c2afd95f","authors":[{"forename":"Joaqu\u00edn","surname":"Ortego"},{"forename":"Erin C.","surname":"Riordan"},{"forename":"Paul Francis","surname":"Gugger"},{"forename":"Victoria L.","surname":"Sork"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Ortego"},{"id":"6016482054","title":"Protected areas in the Spanish Pyrenees: A meaningful way to preserve biodivesity?","type":"Journal Article","volume":"11","issue":"6","url":"http:\/\/omicron.ch.tuiasi.ro\/EEMJ\/","tags":["2012","Aichi_C","ES","GBIF_used","IUCN Red List","Spain","Spain_biodiversity","Target_11","university"],"keywords":["biodiversity","gbif","protected area","pyrenees","species richness"],"pages":"1133-1140","year":"2012","abstract":"The establishment of protected areas is one of the main tools used for biodiversity conservation, one of the components of environmental management.

Digitizing effort and capacity building are costly; and ways should be found to prioritize them rationally. The proposed \u2018Biodiversity Informatics Potential (BIP) Index\u2019 seeks to fulfill such a prioritization role. We propose that the potential for biodiversity informatics be assessed through three concepts: (a) the intrinsic biodiversity potential (the biological richness or ecological diversity) of a country; (b) the capacity of the country to generate biodiversity data records; and (c) the availability of technical infrastructure in a country for managing and publishing such records.; Methods: Broadly; the techniques used to construct the BIP Index were rank correlation; multiple regression analysis; principal components analysis and optimization by linear programming. We built the BIP Index by finding a parsimonious set of country-level human; economic and environmental variables that best predicted the availability of primary biodiversity data accessible through the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) network; and constructing an optimized model with these variables. The model was then applied to all countries for which sufficient data existed; to obtain a score for each country. Countries were ranked according to that score.; Results: Many of the current GBIF participants ranked highly in the BIP Index; although some of them seemed not to have realized their biodiversity informatics potential. The BIP Index attributed low ranking to most non- participant countries; however; a few of them scored highly; suggesting that these would be high-return new participants if encouraged to contribute towards the GBIF mission of free and open access to biodiversity data.; Conclusions: The BIP Index could potentially help in (a) identifying countries most likely to contribute to filling gaps in digitized biodiversity data; (b) assisting countries potentially in need (for example mega-diverse) to mobilize resources and collect data that could be used in decision-making; and (c) allowing identification of which biodiversity informatics-resourced countries could afford to assist countries lacking in biodiversity informatics capacity; and which data-rich countries should benefit most from such help.","uuid":"ae9f1ffd-7a86-35a3-b3bf-a12806461b8f","authors":[{"forename":"Arturo H.","surname":"Ari\u00f1o"},{"forename":"Vishwas","surname":"Chavan"},{"forename":"Nick","surname":"King"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"BMC Bioinformatics","firstAuthor":"Ari\u00f1o"},{"id":"6016480464","title":"Inventory of related wild species of priority crops in Venezuela","type":"Journal Article","volume":"online","url":"http:\/\/www.springerlink.com\/index\/10.1007\/s10722-011-9709-2","tags":["2011","agriculture","ES","GBIF_used","Spain","VE","Venezuela"],"keywords":["crop wild relatives","inventory","plant genetic resources","Venezuela"],"year":"2011","abstract":"A prerequisite in any conservation programme of Plant Genetic Resources is estimation of diversity.

The model showed that nearly 60% of Great Britain shows the minimum bioclimatic suitability for the species, particularly southern and eastern England. Afterwards, a Network Analysis was used to model the natural spatio-temporal spread of the killer shrimp in the Great Ouse River catchment (SE England), the first region invaded by this species. This model suggested that the northern part of the catchment, including two relevant Ramsar sites (Ouse Washes and Wicken fen) are at serious risk of being invaded in the short-term (<5 years). Taking into account the rapid spread of the killer shrimp in other European countries, its broad environmental tolerance, the high climate suitability of broad areas of Great Britain to the species, the current spread of other Ponto-Caspian species, and the high natural and artificial connectivity of the hydrological network, we conclude that D. villosus is very likely to continue its spread in Great Britain, dramatically affecting the native biodiversity.

However, there is a lack of infor- mation about how this tolerance influences invasiveness of exotic species in ecosystems with seasonal drought. To address this question for Mediterranean-type ecosystems (MTE) of the Iberian Peninsula, we carried out an experiment with fifteen phylogenetically related species (8 invasive and 7 native, Pinus pinaster Ait., Pinus radiata D. Don, Schinus molle Linn., Elaeagnus angustifolia L., Eucalyptus globulus Labill., Acacia melanoxylon R. Br., Gleditsia triacanthos L., Pistacia terebinthus L., Rhamnus alaternus L., Anagyris foetida L., Colutea arborescens L., Oenothera biennis L., Epilobium hirsutum L., Achillea filipendulina Lam. and Achillea millefolium L). Seedlings were grown and maximal photochemical efficiency of PSII (Fv\/Fm) was measured at two water availabilities (well-watered and with water stress). PSII thermal tolerance mea- surements were related to specific leaf area (SLA), which varied significantly across the study species, and to the mean potential evapotranspiration (PET) of the month with the lowest precipitation in the native areas of both groups and in the invaded area of the Iberian Peninsula. Additionally, PSII thermal tolerance measurements under water stress were phylogenetically explored. Invasive and native species neither differed in SLA nor in their thermal tolerance under well-watered conditions. For well-watered plants, SLA was significantly and positively related to PSII thermal tolerance when all species were explored together regardless of their invasive nature. However, this relationship did not persist under water stress and invasive species had higher plastic responses than Mediterranean natives resulting in higher leaf temperatures. Higher PSII thermal tolerance could explain invasiveness because it allows for longer peri- ods of carbon acquisition under water stress. In fact, PSII thermal tolerance was positively related to the PET of the invaded and native areas of the Iberian Peninsula. PSII thermal tolerance was not related to PET at the native range of the invasive species, suggesting that successful invasive species were plastic enough to cope with novel dry conditions of the Iberian Peninsula. Moreover, our phylogenetic results indicate that future scenarios of increased aridity in MTE associated to climate change will filter invasion success by taxonomic identity. This study reveals the importance of studying ecophysiological traits to understand and better predict future biological invasions.","uuid":"83c22d09-c7f1-3b49-bdff-5d0b7f359ef1","authors":[{"forename":"Oscar","surname":"Godoy"},{"forename":"Jos\u00e9 Pires","surname":"de Lemos-Filho"},{"forename":"Fernando","surname":"Valladares"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Godoy"},{"id":"6016480384","title":"From Sensor to Observation Web with Environmental Enablers in the Future Internet","type":"Journal Article","volume":"11","issue":"4","url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1424-8220\/11\/4\/3874\/","tags":["2011","AT","Austria","conservation","DE","ES","GB","GBIF_used","Germany","informatics","IT","Italy","NO","Norway","Spain"],"keywords":["environmental enablers","environmental usage area","future internet","internet of content","internet of people","internet of services","internet of things","observation web","open standards","requirements analysis","sensor web"],"pages":"3874-3907","year":"2011","abstract":"This paper outlines the grand challenges in global sustainability research and the objectives of the FP7 Future Internet PPP program within the Digital Agenda for Europe. Large user communities are generating significant amounts of valuable environmental observations at local and regional scales using the devices and services of the Future Internet. These communities\u2019 environmental observations represent a wealth of information which is currently hardly used or used only in isolation and therefore in need of integration with other information sources. Indeed, this very integration will lead to a paradigm shift from a mere Sensor Web to an Observation Web with semantically enriched content emanating from sensors, environmental simulations and citizens. The paper also describes the research challenges to realize the Observation Web and the associated environmental enablers for the Future Internet. Such an environmental enabler could for instance be an electronic sensing device, a web-service application, or even a social networking group affording or facilitating the capability of the Future Internet applications to consume, produce, and use environmental observations in cross-domain applications. The term \u2015envirofied\u2016 Future Internet is coined to describe this overall target that forms a cornerstone of work in the Environmental Usage Area within the Future Internet PPP program. Relevant trends described in the paper are the usage of ubiquitous sensors (anywhere), the provision and generation of information by citizens, and the convergence of real and virtual realities to convey understanding of environmental observations. The paper addresses the technical challenges in the Environmental Usage Area and the need for designing multi-style service oriented architecture. Key topics are the mapping of requirements to capabilities, providing scalability and robustness with implementing context aware information retrieval. Another essential research topic is handling data fusion and model based computation, and the related propagation of information uncertainty. Approaches to security, standardization and harmonization, all essential for sustainable solutions, are summarized from the perspective of the Environmental Usage Area. The paper concludes with an overview of emerging, high impact applications in the environmental areas concerning land ecosystems (biodiversity), air quality (atmospheric conditions) and water ecosystems (marine asset management).","uuid":"7add5e71-bdbc-3824-ab74-998a2414de84","authors":[{"forename":"Denis","surname":"Havlik"},{"forename":"Sven","surname":"Schade"},{"forename":"Zoheir A.","surname":"Sabeur"},{"forename":"Paolo","surname":"Mazzetti"},{"forename":"Kym","surname":"Watson"},{"forename":"Arne J.","surname":"Berre"},{"forename":"Jose Lorenzo","surname":"Mon"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Havlik"},{"id":"6016479394","title":"Taxonomic Revision, Habitats And Biogeography Of The Land Snail Family Discidae (Gastropoda : Pulmonata) In The Canary Islands","type":"Journal Article","volume":"40","issue":"6","url":"http:\/\/www.azoresbioportal.angra.uac.pt\/files\/publicacoes_Holyoak2011_TaxonomicRevisionHabitatsBiogeographyLandSnailFamilyDiscidae.pdf","tags":["2011","conservation","ES","GBIF_acknowledged","GBIF_Switzerland","GBIF_used","Portugal","PT","Spain","Spain (Canary Islands)","university"],"keywords":["africa","atlantica","canaridiscus","genital anatomy","laurasia","laurisilva","macaronesia","madeira","north america","paleobiogeography","penis length","tertiary relict"],"pages":"583-603","year":"2011","abstract":"The endemic Macaronesian Canaridiscus, provisionally placed in the Discidae genus Atlantica, are closely linked to the peculiar laurel forest habitat of these islands. Knowledge of Atlantica (Canaridiscus) is increased here with the description, for the first time, of the genital system of three more of its species. The epiphallus is apparently lacking and the penis is much longer than that known from any of the Discidae of Europe and North America; generally it is too large to be more than partly accommodated in the distal female genital tract. Keraea has been regarded as an endemic Macaronesian genus of Discidae known only from a few shells, but its Madeiran species has been identified as a Trochulus (Hygromiidae) and its type species (from Tenerife) also matches Hygromiidae, not Discidae. The origin and relationships of the Macaronesian Discidae are discussed. The simplest explanatory model is apparently that they represent the last living relicts of a more diverse fauna of Discidae that lived in Europe during the Tertiary; Atlantica (Canaridiscus) was probably isolated early on from the remaining Discidae. Recent literature reports multiple patterns of colonisation of Madeira and the Canaries that have varied between different groups of plants and animals.

The hypothesis that islands might actually represent dynamic refugia and migratory stepping stones for species that are effective dispersers, and in particular, for spore-producing plants, is formally tested here, using the archipelagos of the Azores, Canary Islands, and Madeira, as a model. Population genetic analyses based on nuclear microsatellite variation indicate that dispersal ability of the moss Platyhypnidium riparioides does not decrease in the island setting. The analyses further show that, unlike island populations, mainland (southwestern Europe and North Africa) populations underwent a severe bottleneck during the last glacial maximum (LGM). Our results thus refute the traditional view of islands as the end of the colonization road and point to a different perception of North Atlantic archipelagos as major sources of biodiversity for the postglacial recolonization of Europe by spore-producing plants.","uuid":"67508f6b-70c1-31cc-9f9a-6c715844fb85","authors":[{"forename":"Virginie","surname":"Hutsem\u00e9kers"},{"forename":"P\u00e9ter","surname":"Sz\u00f6v\u00e9nyi"},{"forename":"A.

Chi-square tests were applied to test if category frequency distributions for each species followed a distribution proportional to the relative frequency of categories in each map.

Estimates of size seem necessary to plan for resource allocation for digitization or data capture, and may help to represent how many vouchered primary biodiversity data (in terms of collections, specimens or curatorial units) might remain to be mobilized. It further helps to set priorities, and assess certainties. Three general approaches are proposed for further development, and initial estimates are given. Probabilistic models involve crossing data from a set of biodiversity datasets, finding commonalities and estimating the likelihood of totally obscure data from the fraction of known data missing from specific datasets in the set. Distribution models aim to find the underlying distribution of collections\u2019 compositions, estimating the hidden sector of the distributions. Finally, case studies seek to compare digitized data from collections known to the world to the amount of data known to exist in the collection but not generally available or not digitized. Preliminary estimates of size range from 1.2 to 2.1 gigaunits (109) of which a mere 3% at most is currently web-accessible through GBIF\u2019s mobilization efforts. However, further data and analyses, along with other approaches relying more heavily on surveys, might change the picture and possibly help to narrow the estimate further.

Holoploid and monoploid genome sizes (C- and Cx-values) were determined using propidium iodide flow cytometry in 125 plants of R. parnassifolius s.l. distributed across four European countries. Three different DNA ploidy levels were revealed in the study area: diploid (2n \u223c 2x, 57.14%), triploid (2n \u223c 3x, 1.19%), and tetraploid (2n \u223c 4x, 41.67%). The mean population 2C-values ranged from 8.15 pg in diploids to 14.80 pg in tetraploids, representing a ratio of 1 : 1.8. Marked intraspecific\/interpopulation differences in nuclear DNA content were found. Diploid populations prevail in the Pyrenees, although tetraploid cytotypes were reported throughout the distribution area. In general, mixed-cytotype populations were not found. The Spearman correlation coefficient did not reveal significant correlations between genome size and altitude, longitude, or latitude. Morphometric analyses and cluster analyses based on genome size variation revealed the presence of three major groups, which exhibited a particular biogeographical pattern.

Here, we provide an example of how DNA sequence data, together with morphometric, distributional and ecological information, assist in identifying and diagnosing previously overlooked lineages. The nocturnal, ground-dwelling spider genus Dysdera has colonized all the Macaronesian archipelagos, and has undergone a major diversification in the Canary Islands. A recent molecular phylogenetic analysis of Dysdera species from the eastern Canary Islands revealed deep genetic divergences among some populations, suggesting the existence of cryptic taxa. Here, we combine data from mitochondrial and nuclear loci with morphological and ecological evidence to delimit and formally describe three previously overlooked species: D. aneris sp. nov., endemic to the Salvage Islands; D. mahan sp. nov., distributed along coastal habitats of Lanzarote, north of Fuerteventura and adjacent islets; and D. simbeque sp. nov., restricted to two valleys in northern Lanzarote. Molecular markers provide key information that allows apparent morphological polymorphisms to be used as diagnostic features of evolutionarily independent lineages. Dysdera mahan sp. nov. is unique among the Canarian Dysdera in that it is found in the intertidal zone on pebbled beaches. Low levels of genetic variability and genital differentiation associated with relatively high somatic divergence suggest that speciation in D. mahan sp. nov. was driven by a selection of phenotypic traits that are adaptive to this rare environment. Separate analyses and statistical tests revealed phylogenetic incongruence between mitochondrial and nuclear genes, probably as a result of incomplete lineage sorting. The temporal framework for the origin and diversification of the new species inferred from the molecular data corroborates former hypotheses on the late Pliocene origin of the present-day biota of the Salvage Islands.","uuid":"3e47235c-54be-3d18-9c7f-efb9090067b2","authors":[{"forename":"Nuria","surname":"Mac\u00edas-Hern\u00e1ndez"},{"forename":"Pedro","surname":"Orom\u00ed"},{"forename":"Miquel A.","surname":"Arnedo"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Mac\u00edas-Hern\u00e1ndez"},{"id":"6016477184","title":"Checklist Of Benthic Algae From The Asturias Coast (North Of Spain)","type":"Journal Article","volume":"51","url":"http:\/\/www.ridea.org\/biblioteca\/bolciencias\/bolciencias_51_0135-0212.pdf","tags":["2010","conservation","ES","GBIF_used","Spain"],"keywords":["Biogeography","Cantabrian Sea","Checklist","Iberian Peninsula","Seaweeds","Systematics"],"pages":"135-212","year":"2010","abstract":"An annotated checklist of the marine benthic flora of Asturias coast (North of Spain), based on literature records, herbarium sheets and original data is presented.

The number of specific and intraspe- cific taxa is 459: 42 Cyanophyta, 247 Rhodophyta, 111 Ochrophyta and 59 Chlorophyta. Phormidium autumnale, Drachiella spectabilis and Peyssonnelia harveyana are new records for Asturias. In addition, 18 taxa are considered as taxa excludenda, while 34 taxa were recorded as dubious and their presence in the coasts of Asturias must be con- firmed and thoroughly studied in the future. Remarks on the most noteworthy features of the flora of the studied area are included. Also, we present lists of cold-temperate, warm- temperate, Lusitanic Province endemics, and alien species growing in Asturias. Finally, we compared the floristic character of Asturias coast flora with respect to the neighbour- ing regions (Britain, Ireland, Basque coast, Galicia, Portugal, Southern Iberian Peninsu- la, Canary Islands and Atlantic coast of Morocco) applying Feldmann\u2019s [Rhodophyta\/ Phaeophyta, or R\/P] and Cheney\u2019s ratios [(Rhodophyta+Chlorophyta)\/ Phaeophyta, or (R+C)\/P]. The resulting low values (2.36 and 2.91, respectively) are explained by the abundance of numerous cold temperate species like large fucoids and kelps.","uuid":"bd45b549-8295-3ff2-8279-3549017644b3","authors":[{"forename":"Eduardo Cires","surname":"Rodr\u00edguez"},{"forename":"Candela Cuesta","surname":"Moliner"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Rodr\u00edguez"},{"id":"6016477804","title":"Aportaciones al conocimiento de la flora hal\u00f3fila de Andaluc\u00eda","type":"Journal Article","volume":"34","url":"http:\/\/www.bioveg.uma.es\/abm\/Volumenes\/vol34\/34_Lendinez_et_al.pdf","tags":["2009","ES","GBIF_used","not_done","Spain","Spanish"],"keywords":[],"pages":"275-280","year":"2009","uuid":"aa4f7703-aa27-37b2-ad02-d86328ba755b","authors":[{"forename":"M\u00aa Luc\u00eda","surname":"Lend\u00ednez"},{"forename":"Francisco M.","surname":"Marchal"},{"forename":"Juan Quesada y Carlos","surname":"Salazar"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Acta Botanica Malacitana","firstAuthor":"Lend\u00ednez"},{"id":"6016475354","title":"Assessing the accuracy of species distribution models to predict amphibian species richness patterns.","type":"Journal Article","volume":"78","issue":"1","url":"http:\/\/www.azoresbioportal.angra.uac.pt\/files\/publicacoes_Pineda  Lobo 2009.pdf\nhttp:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18771504","tags":["2009","Aichi_E","conservation","ES","GBIF_used","Mexico","Mexico_biodiversity","MX","niche_modeling","SDM","Spain","Target_19"],"keywords":["Amphibians","Amphibians: physiology","Animals","Biodiversity","Biological","Mexico","Models"],"pages":"182-90","year":"2009","abstract":"1. Evaluating the distribution of species richness where biodiversity is high but has been insufficiently sampled is not an easy task. Species distribution modelling has become a useful approach for predicting their ranges, based on the relationships between species records and environmental variables. Overlapping predictions of individual distributions could be a useful strategy for obtaining estimates of species richness and composition in a region, but these estimates should be evaluated using a proper validation process, which compares the predicted richness values and composition with accurate data from independent sources. 2. In this study, we propose a simple approach to estimate model performance for several distributional predictions generated simultaneously. This approach is particularly suitable when species distribution modelling techniques that require only presence data are used. 3. The individual distributions for the 370 known amphibian species of Mexico were predicted using maxent to model data on their known presence (66,113 presence-only records). Distributions were subsequently overlapped to obtain a prediction of species richness. Accuracy was assessed by comparing the overall species richness values predicted for the region with observed and predicted values from 118 well-surveyed sites, each with an area of c. 100 km(2), which were identified using species accumulation curves and nonparametric estimators. 4. The derived models revealed a remarkable heterogeneity of species richness across the country, provided information about species composition per site and allowed us to obtain a measure of the spatial distribution of prediction errors. Examining the magnitude and location of model inaccuracies, as well as separately assessing errors of both commission and omission, highlights the inaccuracy of the predictions of species distribution models and the need to provide measures of uncertainty along with the model results. 5. The combination of a species distribution modelling method like maxent and species richness estimators offers a useful tool for identifying when the overall pattern provided by all model predictions might be representing the geographical patterns of species richness and composition, regardless of the particular quality or accuracy of the predictions for each individual species.","uuid":"06628f07-3118-391d-8818-362b1eb7a386","authors":[{"forename":"Eduardo","surname":"Pineda"},{"forename":"Jorge M","surname":"Lobo"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"The Journal of animal ecology","firstAuthor":"Pineda"},{"id":"6016477844","title":"A Review of Neotropical Myxomycetes (1828-2008)","type":"Journal Article","volume":"65","issue":"2","url":"http:\/\/digital.csic.es\/bitstream\/10261\/15217\/3\/288.pdf","tags":["2008","ES","GBIF_used","Spain"],"keywords":[],"pages":"211-254","year":"2008","uuid":"be3da92f-c45d-332d-9ed5-3045719ddadd","authors":[{"forename":"Carlos","surname":"Lado"},{"forename":"Diana Wrigley","surname":"de Basanta"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Anales del Jard\u00edn Bot\u00e1nico de Madrid","firstAuthor":"Lado"},{"id":"6016476144","title":"Regional assessment of plant invasions across different habitat types","type":"Journal Article","volume":"18","issue":"1","url":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1658\/1100-9233(2007)18[35:RAOPIA]2.0.CO;2","tags":["2007","Aichi_B","ES","GBIF_used","invasive","Spain","Spain_biodiversity","Target_9","university"],"keywords":["Alien plant","EUNIS","Mediterranean community","Relev\u00e9","Species richness","Vegetation type"],"pages":"35","year":"2007","abstract":"Questions: 1. Which habitats have the highest degree of invasion? 2. Do native species-rich communities have also a high degree of invasion? 3. Do the patterns of association between native and alien species richness vary between habitats. Location: Catalonia region (NE Spain). Methods: We conducted a large regional analysis of 15 655 phytosociological relev\u00e9s to detect differences in the degree of invasion between European Nature Information System (EUNIS) habitats representative of temperate and Mediterranean European areas. Results: Alien species were present in less than 17 % of the relev\u00e9s and represented less than 2% of the total number of species per habitat. The EUNIS habitats with the highest alien species richness were arable land and gardens followed by anthropogenic forb-rich habitats, riverine and lakeshore scrubs, southern riparian galleries and thickets and trampled areas. In contrast, the following habitats had never any alien species: surface running waters, raised and blanket bogs, valley mires, poor fens and transition mires, base-rich fens, alpine and sub-alpine grasslands, sub-alpine moist or wet tall-herb and fern habitats, alpine and sub-alpine scrub habitats and spiny Mediterranean heaths. There was a unimodal relationship between the mean native and mean alien species richness per EUNIS habitat with a high number of aliens in habitats with intermediate number of native species and a low number of aliens at both extremes of the native species gradient. Within EUNIS habitats, the relationship was positive, negative or non-significant depending on the habitat type without any clear pattern related to the number of native species. Alien species richness was not related to plot size, neither between habitats nor within habitats. Conclusions: The analysis emphasised that the habitats with a higher degree of invasion were the most disturbed ones and that in general habitats rich in native species did not harbour less invaders than habitats poor in native species.","uuid":"71465ba3-4082-36f4-8d93-1e0d572f83ef","authors":[{"forename":"Vil\u00e0","surname":"Montserrat"},{"forename":"Pino","surname":"Joan"},{"forename":"Font","surname":"Xavier"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Journal of Vegetation Science","firstAuthor":"Montserrat"},{"id":"6016477464","title":"Shell and hinge morphology of juvenile Limopsis (Bivalvia: Arcoida) \u2013 implications for limopsid evolution Published in collaboration with the University of Bergen and the Institute of Marine Research, Norway, and the Marine Biological Laboratory, Universi","type":"Journal Article","volume":"1","issue":"5","url":"http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/17451000500384100","tags":["2005","Denmark","DK","ES","GBIF_used","marine_biodiversity","NO","Norway","SE","Spain","Sweden","university"],"keywords":["Bivalvia","early ontogeny","evolution","Limopsidae","morphogenesis","shell morphology"],"pages":"350-364","year":"2005","abstract":"Early ontogenetic shells of Limopsis angusta, L. aurita , L. cristata , L. friedbergi and L. minuta are described in detail and their morphogenetic traits discussed in a phylogenetic context. Prodissoconch length is found to range from 170\ue001\/ 370 mm discounting the so-called prodissoconch 2 stage of authors. Reports of such a stage refer to the early postlarval \u2018interdissoconch\u2019. Prodissoconch sizes are indicative of lecithotrophy but not of brooding. Limopsid-like prodissoconchs are rather common among pteriomorphs and at present of little use for phylogenetic interpretations, therefore. The early postlarval hinge is characterized by two tooth generations: an early one, (G1), representing the postlarval continuation of provincular teeth, and a late one, (G2), representing the independent adult dentition. This is a plesiomorphic trait for Pteriomorphia. The postlarval ligament is continuous with the larval resilium; it is neither co-functional with nor is it substituted by the typical duplivincular ligament as in other arcoids. Occasionally developed ridges, gutters or multiplication of ligament sublayers remain restricted to the primordial resilifer. It is concluded that the limopsid adult ligament represents a fusion of adult sublayer repetition within a retained larval resilium, a phenomenon best described as a heterochronic process. Comparisons with homologous characters of other arcoids support the view that Limopsidae evolved from parallelodontid arcoids and that they gave rise to Philobryidae but not to Glycymerididae.","uuid":"013792c2-5c97-3b4e-8186-763135f15311","authors":[{"forename":"Nikolaus","surname":"Malchus"},{"forename":"Anders","surname":"War\u00e9n"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Malchus"}]
