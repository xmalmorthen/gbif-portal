Its distribution range has since expanded to the middle, south and southwest of North America, where invasive P. australis has replaced millions of hectares of native plants in inland and tidal wetlands. Another P. australis invasion from the Mediterranean region is simultaneously occurring in the Gulf region of the USA and some countries in South America. Here, we analysed the occurrence records of the two Old World invasive lineages of P. australis (Haplotype M and Med) in both their native and introduced ranges using environmental niche models (ENMs) to assess (i) whether a niche shift accompanied the invasions in the New World; (ii) the role of biologically relevant climatic variables and human influence in the process of invasion; and (iii) the current potential distribution of these two lineages. We detected local niche shifts along the East Coast of North America and the Gulf Coast of the USA for Haplotype M and around the Mississippi Delta and Florida of the USA for Med. The new niche of introduced Haplotype M accounts for temperature fluctuations and increased precipitation. The introduced Med lineage has enlarged its original subtropical niche to the tropics-subtropics, invading regions with a high annual mean temperature (> c. 10 \u00b0C) and high precipitation in the driest period. Human influence is an important factor for both niches. We suggest that an increase in precipitation in the 20(th) century, global warming and human-made habitats have shaped the invasive niches of the two lineages in the New World. However, as the invasions are on-going and human and natural disturbances occur concomitantly, the future distribution ranges of the two lineages may diverge from the potential distribution ranges detected in this study.

Location East Asia. Methods Phylogenetic analyses were carried out using four mitochondrial fragments and seven nuclear loci from 161 birds sampled from 29 localities spanning the entire geographical range of the green-backed tit. We used *beast to estimate the species tree and calculate divergence times. Extended Bayesian skyline plots were used to infer potential historical shifts in population size. We used MaxEnt to predict potential distributions during three periods: the present day, the Last Glacial Maximum and the Last Interglacial. Results The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) gene tree showed strong support for three reciprocally monophyletic groups: a south-western clade, a central clade and a Taiwanese clade. Taiwanese and Vietnamese samples had fixed differences at several nuclear loci, but the south-western and central samples shared haplotypes at all nuclear loci. The mtDNA gene tree topology differed from the species tree topology. The species tree suggested sister relationships between Taiwanese and Vietnamese operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and between south-western and central OTUs. Diversification within the green-backed tit was relatively recent, probably within the last 0.9 million years. Extended Bayesian skyline plots suggested rapid population expansion in the south-western and central phylogroups after the Last Interglacial, and this result was consistent with ecological niche models. Main conclusions Our results suggest that genetic diversification within the green-backed tit was affected by the later Pleistocene climate fluctuations. Ecological niche models indicated that the present-day vegetation distribution was, in many ways, more similar to that of the Last Glacial Maximum than it was to that of the Last Interglacial. Continental populations of the green-backed tit experienced unusual demographic and range expansion that is likely to have occurred during the cooling transition between the Last Interglacial and the Last Glacial Maximum. We found incongruence between the mtDNA gene tree and the species tree, which underscores the importance of using both mitochondrial and nuclear markers when estimating the evolutionary history of populations.","uuid":"ca8ca6ca-272c-3749-ac67-d731089f775a","authors":[{"forename":"Wenjuan","surname":"Wang"},{"forename":"Bailey D.","surname":"McKay"},{"forename":"Chuanyin","surname":"Dai"},{"forename":"Na","surname":"Zhao"},{"forename":"Ruiying","surname":"Zhang"},{"forename":"Yanhua","surname":"Qu"},{"forename":"Gang","surname":"Song"},{"forename":"Shou-Hsien","surname":"Li"},{"forename":"Wei","surname":"Liang"},{"forename":"Xiaojun","surname":"Yang"},{"forename":"Eric","surname":"Pasquet"},{"forename":"Fumin","surname":"Lei"}],"editors":[{"forename":"Michael","surname":"Patten"}],"publication_outlet":"Journal of Biogeography","firstAuthor":"Wang"},{"id":"6016482324","title":"Nowhere to Invade: Rumex crispus and Typha latifolia Projected to Disappear under Future Climate Scenarios.","type":"Journal Article","volume":"8","issue":"7","url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23923020","tags":["2013","Aichi_B","China","CN","GBIF_primary","GBIF_used","GBIF_VIP","GBits_10","global_biodiversity","invasive","Target_9"],"keywords":[],"pages":"e70728","year":"2013","abstract":"Future climate change has been predicted to affect the potential distribution of plant species.

In this study, we predicted the potential distributions of two invasive species, Rumex crispus and Typha latifolia, under current and future (2050) climatic conditions. Future climate scenarios considered in our study include A1B, A2, A2A, B1, and B2A. We found that these two species will lose their habitat under the A1B, A2, A2A, and B1 scenarios. Their distributions will be maintained under future climatic conditions related to B2A scenarios, but the total area will be less than 10% of that under the current climatic condition. We also investigated variations of the most influential climatic variables that are likely to cause habitat loss of the two species. Our results demonstrate that rising mean annual temperature, variations of the coldest quarter, and precipitation of the coldest quarter are the main factors contributing to habitat loss of R. crispus. For T. latifolia, the main factors are rising mean annual temperature, variations in temperature of the coldest quarter, mean annual precipitation, and precipitation of the coldest quarter. These results demonstrate that the warmer and wetter climatic conditions of the coldest season (or month) will be mainly responsible for habitat loss of R. crispus and T. latifolia in the future.

The western conifer seed bug, Leptoglossus occidentalis, native to western North America, has expanded its range eastward and has become an invasive pest in Europe and Asia. Niche models calibrated on the ranges of a small native population and two large expanding populations were compared. We found that the climate niche of L. occidentalis is conserved during its steady expansion in North America and rapid spread in Europe. Models based on the small western native range successfully captured the eastern expanding and introduced European populations, whereas the large area-based models varied with the presumed state of equilibrium. The equilibrium state based model succeeded but the non-equilibrium based model failed to predict the range in Europe.

The ice recrystallization inhibition proteins (IRIP) genes, fructosyltransferase (FST) genes, and many C-repeat binding factor (CBF) genes are Pooideae specific and important in low temperature responses. Here we use comparative analyses to study conservation and evolution of these gene families in B. distachyon to better understand B. distachyon's potential as a model species for agriculturally important temperate grasses RESULTS: Brachypodium distachyon contains cold responsive IRIP genes which have evolved through Brachypodium specific gene family expansions. A large cold responsive CBF3 subfamily was identified in B. distachyon, while CBF4 homologs are absent from the genome. No B. distachyon FST gene homologs encode typical core Pooideae FST-motifs and low temperature induced fructan accumulation was dramatically different in B. distachyon compared to core Pooideae species.

These differences limit the use of B. distachyon as a model for holistic studies relevant for agricultural core Pooideae species.","uuid":"2b830fd2-f2f0-39e9-93cc-396482d47edd","authors":[{"forename":"Chuan","surname":"Li"},{"forename":"Heidi","surname":"Rudi"},{"forename":"Eric J.","surname":"Stockinger"},{"forename":"Hongmei","surname":"Cheng"},{"forename":"Moju","surname":"Cao"},{"forename":"Samuel E.","surname":"Fox"},{"forename":"Todd C.","surname":"Mockler"},{"forename":"Bj\u00f8rge","surname":"Westereng"},{"forename":"Siri","surname":"Fjellheim"},{"forename":"Odd Arne","surname":"Rognli"},{"forename":"Simen R.","surname":"Sandve"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Li"},{"id":"6016484754","title":"Environmental Suitability of the Red Spider Mite Tetranchus cinnabarinus (Acari: Tetranychidae) among Cassava in China","type":"Journal Article","volume":"518-523","url":"http:\/\/www.scientific.net\/AMR.518-523.5446","tags":["2012","China","China_biodiversity","CN","GBIF_used","need_copy","not_done"],"keywords":["Cassava","China","Environmental Suitability","Tetranychus cinnbarinus"],"pages":"5446-5449","year":"2012","abstract":"The red spider mite (Tetranchus cinnabarinus Boisduval) is one of the main pests in the world and the risk of invasion posed by this mite is becoming more and more serious with regard to increasing areas of planting cassava in China.

The data were collected from 109 peer-reviewed publications and consisted of 367 objects for ash composition analysis. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to analyze the data. The analyses were performed at five levels of plant classifications respectively: level 1\u20133 for life-forms\/species groups, level 4 for assortments and level 5 for species. Woody species data points tended to differ from herbaceous ones in terms of PCA for level 1 analysis. The loading plot of the two first components (PC1 and PC2) indicated that the woody species tended to be associated with Ca\u2013Mg\u2013P\u2013K\u2013S, while the herbaceous ones were closer to Si. Ca and Si had the largest contributions in forming the pattern. The woody group had a larger variation than the herbaceous group in terms of ash composition but this could be explained only by differentiation in assortments as illustrated with the level 4 analysis. The PCA analyses at levels 2 and 3 did not generate significant patterns, as the variations within the groups were larger than between the groups. The variation of the herbaceous data, however, could be explained by all level 2\u20135 analyses and attributed to differences between herbaceous dicots and graminoids, between C3 and C4 plants, and between assortments such as husk, fruit residues and bagasse. The robust analysis had in general the same results. These results could be further interpreted by the trend that Si decreased but Ca increased gradually in the following order: C3 graminoids \u2192 C4 graminoids \u2192 herbaceous dicots \u2192 woody groups. It was also found that K, P, Mg and S were higher in herbaceous dicots than in graminoids.","uuid":"0c51670b-9863-39e9-b8fb-7bb02370380a","authors":[{"forename":"Guangcan","surname":"Tao"},{"forename":"Torbj\u00f6rn A.","surname":"Lestander"},{"forename":"Paul","surname":"Geladi"},{"forename":"Shaojun","surname":"Xiong"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Tao"},{"id":"6016482164","title":"Molecular phylogenetics and historical biogeography of the Meiogyne-Fitzalania clade (Annonaceae): Generic paraphyly and late Miocene-Pliocene diversification in Australasia and the Pacific","type":"Journal Article","volume":"61","issue":"3","url":"http:\/\/www.ingentaconnect.com\/content\/iapt\/tax\/2012\/00000061\/00000003\/art00006?token=003912832c7b76504c48663b256a493e6c243f386f576a333f2576a8d#expand\/collapse","tags":["2012","AU","Australia","China","CN","GBIF_used","IN","India","need_copy","Netherlands","NL","not_done","university"],"notes":"KU doesn&#039;t have subscription","keywords":[],"pages":"559-575","year":"2012","abstract":"Meiogyne (Annonaceae) comprises 15 species of trees and shrubs distributed in India, Indomalaya and Australasia-Pacific. Previous molecular phylogenetic analyses, based on limited taxon sampling, have indicated that the small genus Fitzalania (2 spp.) is nested within Meiogyne. The centre of diversity of the Meiogyne-Fitzalania group lies in Australia (6 spp.) and New Caledonia (4 spp.); this is unique in Annonaceae, some of whose Australian and New Caledonian lineages have been hypothesised to have originated in situ from Gondwanan ancestors. Phylogenetic reconstructions based on chloroplast DNA sequence data of 19 accessions, representing 14 of the 17 species in the Meiogyne-Fitzalania group (ca. 8.6 kb) as well as 67 representatives of all major clades of Annonaceae (ca. 5.1 kb), were performed to clarify the phylogenetic relationships of Meiogyne and Fitzalania. The results show that Fitzalania is deeply nested within an Australasian-Pacific clade of Meiogyne species. The inclusion of species assigned to hieniodendron and Oncodostigma in eiogyne, as proposed in the most recent revision of Meiogyne, is also corroborated. Fossil-calibrated molecular divergence estimates under an uncorrelated-rates relaxed molecular clock model were used to investigate the timing of the crown group diversification. The Meiogyne crown group was inferred to have originated in the late Oligocene or Miocene, and initially diversified in continental Southeast Asia, western Malesia and the Philippines. All Australasian-Pacific taxa formed a single derived clade, and most diversification within this clade occurred in the late Miocene and Pliocene. A complex combination of factors such as fragmentation of once wider distribution areas due to climate fluctuations and subsequent vicariance, range expansion by dispersal to Pacific islands and subsequent differentiation, and ecological adaptation to local climatic and edaphic habitat conditions is hypothesised to underlie the diversification of Meiogyne in Australasia and the Pacific.","uuid":"b01b67ba-3d9d-3224-8349-6da810329b37","authors":[{"forename":"Daniel C.","surname":"Thomas"},{"forename":"Siddharthan","surname":"Surveswaran"},{"forename":"Bine","surname":"Xue"},{"forename":"Garry","surname":"Sankowsky"},{"forename":"Johan B.","surname":"Mols"},{"forename":"Paul J.A.","surname":"Ke\u00dfler"},{"forename":"Richard M.K.","surname":"Saunders"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Thomas"},{"id":"6016484444","title":"The African wintering distribution and ecology of the Corncrake Crex crex","type":"Journal Article","url":"http:\/\/www.journals.cambridge.org\/abstract_S0959270912000159","tags":["2012","Africa","Africa_biodiversity","Aichi_E","birds","China","CN","conservation","FR","France","GB","GBIF_used","in_press","South Africa","Target_19","ZA"],"keywords":[],"pages":"1-14","year":"2012","abstract":"The Corncrake Crex crex breeds in the Palearctic but overwinters in central and southern Africa.

Our model was based mostly on climatic variables and predicts a high suitability for most eastern Africa countries south of the equator, but none of the western African countries with the exception of Angola and Namibia. Both the actual number of records as well as the distribution model thus indicates that the vast majority of Corncrakes migrate through and overwinter in the eastern parts of Africa. Because large parts of Angola, Mozambique, north-eastern Namibia, and Tanzania are predicted as suitable but have yielded very few actual records so far, they should be targeted for future field work. A very small number of Corncrakes may oversummer in Africa but such individuals are possibly unable to migrate due to sickness or injury, or may be first-year birds that are not ready to breed. An analysis of habitat and population density data indicates that, within the continental distribution, Corncrakes are mostly concentrated within grass-dominated habitats, mirroring their habitat preferences in the breeding areas. Corncrakes reach their wintering distribution mostly through an eastern migration route, but some individuals or subpopulations from the Western breeding population also use a western migration route. We also document the food choices, weights, and causes of injury and death within Africa. Because habitat conversion is accelerating all across Africa, we recommend constant monitoring of habitat availability and population densities within the Corncrake\u2019s wintering distribution.","uuid":"0419a91b-8795-3f72-8257-5767a66d491c","authors":[{"forename":"Bruno A.","surname":"Walther"},{"forename":"P.","surname":"Barry Taylor"},{"forename":"Norbert","surname":"Sch\u00e4ffer"},{"forename":"Sue","surname":"Robinson"},{"forename":"Frederic Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric","surname":"Jiguet"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Bird Conservation International","firstAuthor":"Walther"},{"id":"6016481594","title":"Potential Geographic Distribution of Brown Marmorated Stink Bug Invasion (Halyomorpha halys)","type":"Journal Article","volume":"7","issue":"2","url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0031246","tags":["2012","agriculture","Aichi_B","China","CN","GBIF_used","GBIF_VIP","invasive","Japan_biodiversity","niche_modeling","SDM","South Korea_biodiversity","Target_9","university"],"keywords":[],"pages":"e31246","year":"2012","abstract":"Background: The Brown Marmorated Stink Bug (BMSB), Halyomorpha halys (Sta\u00b0l) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae), native to Asia, is becoming an invasive species with a rapidly expanding range in North America and Europe. In the US, it is a household pest and also caused unprecedented damage to agriculture crops. Exploring its climatic limits and estimating its potential geographic distribution can provide critical information for management strategies. Methodology\/Principals: We used direct climate comparisons to explore the climatic niche occupied by native and invasive populations of BMSB. Ecological niche modelings based on the native range were used to anticipate the potential distribution of BMSB worldwide. Conversely, niche models based on the introduced range were used to locate the original invasive propagates in Asia. Areas with high invasion potential were identified by two niche modeling algorithms (i.e., Maxent and GARP). Conclusions\/Significance: Reduced dimensionality of environmental space improves native model transferability in the invade area. Projecting models from invasive population back to native distributional areas offers valuable information on the potential source regions of the invasive populations. Our models anticipated successfully the current disjunct distribution of BMSB in the US. The original propagates are hypothesized to have come from northern Japan or western Korea.

Research using this database has led to an improved understanding of the migrants\u2019 distributions, especially of threatened species such as the Corncrake Crex crex, the Aquatic Warbler Acrocephalus paludicola, the Basra Reed Warbler Acrocephalus griseldis, the Cinereous Bunting Emberiza cineracea and the Ortolan Bunting Emberiza hortulana, as well as the identification of habitat use, macroecology and conservation priority areas. In this study, we used the available point-locality records to map the sub-Saharan distribution of 65 species of passerine migrants using a combination of presence-only and presence-absence distribution modelling techniques (Walther et al. 2010). Combining these distributions with data on the conservation status and population declines of 64 of these 65 species published by BirdLife International, we found that species which declined during the period 1970\u2013 2000 were concentrated in the Sahelian region, while species with more stable populations were overwintering all across Africa. This clear geographical signal then led to a comprehensive literature review of recent climatological, biological and ecological changes in the Sahelian and more southerly Sudanian zone. The main conclusions are: (1) the 1968\u20131997 drought was exceptionally severe; (2) year-to-year climatic variability was very high in the Sahel, and higher than in the rest of sub-Saharan Africa; (3) these climate extremes had unusually strong repercussions on soil erosion, above- and below-ground water levels, and natural vegetation, especially perennial woody vegetation, with some negative effects still apparent to this day despite the recent re-greening of the Sahel; (4) driven by one of the highest human population growth rates in the world, agricultural expansion and loss of natural non-forest vegetation was higher in the Sahelian and Sudanian zones than in any other sub-Saharan region; (5) the effects of cattle grazing and wood exploitation may also have been more severe in this region than in other sub-Saharan regions. The implications for migrant birds are that, even before the drought beginning in the late 1960s, there was a long-term trend of humans appropriating more and more natural resources, recently accelerated through exponential population growth and more intensive agricultural methods. Therefore, fewer and fewer natural resources are being left for animal populations, including migrant birds. The recent re-greening of the Sahel and the parallel improvements in agricultural techniques during the last decade have improved the welfare of human populations, but have had no or very little positiveeffect on natural resources utilized by wild animal populations. This widespread ecological transformation, which was apparently more severe in the Sahelian region than in any other sub- Saharan region, may therefore be one of the main long-term drivers of the population declines of those migrants which mainly overwinter in these regions, and possibly even for bird species which use these regions only for refuelling. Discussing the results from this and other recent studies, we finish by making a few recommendations for future research and conservation work.","uuid":"255c0d5d-02a3-3bc1-b597-2717a648e6d0","authors":[{"forename":"Bruno A.","surname":"Walther"},{"forename":"Adriaan Van","surname":"Niekerk"},{"forename":"Carsten","surname":"Rahbek"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Walther"},{"id":"6016475404","title":"Distorted views of biodiversity: spatial and temporal bias in species occurrence data","type":"Journal Article","volume":"8","issue":"6","url":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pbio.1000385\nhttp:\/\/www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov\/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2879389&tool=pmcentrez&rendertype=abstract","tags":["2010","Aichi_E","AU","Australia","China","CN","conservation","CSIRO","GB","GBIF_used","GBIF_VIP","global_biodiversity","IUCN Red List","Target_19"],"notes":"\n        <m:bold>From Duplicate 1 ( <\/m:bold>\n        <m:bold><\/m:bold>\n        <m:bold>\n          <m:italic>Distorted Views of Biodiversity: Spatial and Temporal Bias in Species Occurrence Data<\/m:italic>\n        <\/m:bold>\n        <m:bold><\/m:bold>\n        <m:bold> - Boakes, Elizabeth H; McGowan, Philip J K; Fuller, Richard A; Chang-qing, Ding; Clark, Natalie E; O&#039;Connor, Kim; Mace, Georgina M )<m:linebreak><\/m:linebreak>\n        <\/m:bold>\n        <m:linebreak><\/m:linebreak>\n        <m:linebreak><\/m:linebreak>\n        <m:linebreak><\/m:linebreak>\n      ","keywords":["Animals","Biodiversity"],"pages":"e1000385","year":"2010","publisher":"Public Library of Science","abstract":"Boakes et al. compile and analyze a historical dataset of 170,000 bird sightings over two centuries and show how changing trends in data gathering may confound a true picture of biodiversity change.","uuid":"f36647c3-1069-3f8a-a065-6c599dce2f6d","authors":[{"forename":"Elizabeth H.","surname":"Boakes"},{"forename":"Philip J.

Currently, E. adenophorum\u2019s main colonisation area is located in the Yunnan\u2013Guizhou Plateau of China, where it has caused prominent economic and ecological problems. Sixty-three years ago, Crofton weed appeared in Menghai county, Yunnan Province, from where it dispersed northwards and eastwards at an average speed of 20 km year\u22121. The invasion of E. adenophorum nonetheless showed pronounced variations in both time and space. Spread was relatively slow in the initial invasion period between 1940 and 1950, while the most rapid range expansions occurred in the 1980s. Environmental conditions at native and invaded sites were significantly different, reflecting a great adaptability of the species during colonization. These changes were greater than habitat differences between colonized and many adjacent un-colonized sites in Southern China. Therefore, immediate measures are required to stop a further northward and eastward expansion of Crofton weed.","uuid":"1315f37c-e8e1-3931-bef5-b2d9c025c06c","authors":[{"forename":"Weiguo","surname":"Sang"},{"forename":"Li","surname":"Zhu"},{"forename":"Jan","surname":"Axmacher"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Sang"},{"id":"6016476794","title":"Biodiversity inventory and informatics in Southeast Asia","type":"Journal Article","volume":"19","issue":"4","url":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/s10531-010-9817-x","tags":["2010","China","Chinese Academy of Sciences","CN","GBIF_used","Harvard University","Herbarium Bogoriense","ID","Indonesia","Southeast Asia","standards"],"keywords":["biodiversity","taxonomy"],"pages":"955-972","year":"2010","publisher":"Springer Netherlands","abstract":"Rapidly changing land use in Southeast Asia threatens plant diversity, and reduces the time we have left to document it. Despite over 200 years of scientific plant exploration, many plant species have yet to be discovered. Moreover, we still have a very poor understanding of the distribution of known taxa in this biogeographically complex region. We review the current state of biodiversity exploration, using plants in Indonesia as an example. Traditional methods of collecting and describing species have provided a solid foundation for our understanding of plant biodiversity, but are insufficient for the pragmatic task of rapidly discovering and documenting today\u2019s biodiversity before it is gone, because general collecting expeditions tend to be infrequent, and documentation of most new species must await taxonomic revisions many years in the future. Solutions to this exploration and documentation crisis (i) could use the abundant resource of enthusiastic, networked, national biology students, (ii) should employ biodiversity informatics tools to efficiently engage both specialists and parataxonomists, and (iii) might require adoption of new types of \u03b1-taxonomy, utilizing increasingly low-cost molecular methods and high resolution photographs. We describe emerging technologies that will facilitate this taxonomic development. We believe that a new golden age of biodiversity exploration may be dawning, just as biodiversity itself is most threatened, and are hopeful that increasing knowledge of biodiversity will be a positive force to slow its loss.","uuid":"70b01d21-2c75-3d3f-9f61-6b99dc305075","authors":[{"forename":"Campbell O.","surname":"Webb"},{"forename":"J.","surname":"Slik"},{"forename":"Teguh","surname":"Triono"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Webb"},{"id":"6016477314","title":"Prediction of potential suitable distribution area of Flaveria bidentis in China based on niche models","type":"Journal Article","volume":"21","issue":"12","url":"http:\/\/www.cjae.net\/CN\/article\/downloadArticleFile.do?attachType=PDF&id=12167","tags":["2010","China","Chinese","CN","GBIF_used","niche_modeling","plants","SDM"],"keywords":["Flaveria bidentis","niche","potential suitable distribution area"],"pages":"3063-3069","year":"2010","abstract":"Based on the distribution records of Flaveria bidentis in China, and by using five ecological niche models (GARP, Maxent, ENFA, Bioclim, and Domain), 32 ecogeographical variables were chosen to simulate the potential suitable distribution area of F. bidentis in the country, and the simulation precision of the models was assessed by the method of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.
