With this record, the known geographical distribution of P. tinctorium is now extended up to the foothills of the Eastern Himalayas in Southeast Asia. The species was recorded from the tropical moist deciduous forests of Meghalaya. The habitat of P. tinctorium was characterized by the presence of surface lime-stone with karst topography. Future investigations should aim at identifying the factors responsible for the restricted distribution of this species so that appropriate conservation measures can be taken.","uuid":"cc7c748b-6328-3098-a776-fa97b7cbe6e0","authors":[{"forename":"Bikarma","surname":"Singh"},{"forename":"Dibyendu","surname":"Adhikari"},{"forename":"Saroj Kanta","surname":"Barik"},{"forename":"Arun","surname":"Chettri"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Check List","firstAuthor":"Singh"},{"id":"6016482124","title":"Modeling environmental niche of Himalayan birch and remote sensing based vicarious validation","type":"Journal Article","volume":"54","issue":"3","url":"http:\/\/www.tropecol.com\/online\/default.htm","tags":["2013","Aichi_E","GARP","GBIF_primary","GBIF_used","GBits_8","IN","India","India_biodiversity","niche_modeling","plants","remote_sensing","SDM","Target_19"],"keywords":[],"pages":"319-327","year":"2013","abstract":"The objective of the study was to model the environmental niche of a dominant treeline species (Himalayan birch or Betula utilis) in alpine region of Indian Himalaya and validate the findings using ground truth supported satellite remote sensing technique. It deals with the generation of bioclimatic indices from temperature and precipitation data, followed by fundamental environmental niche modeling based on the presence-only records of the alpine treeline ecotone (ATE) boundary species. The predicted fundamental environmental niche was validated in Uttarakhand, India using the alpine treeline ecotone boundary (a surrogate to realized niche), which was generated using IRS-P6 (LISS-III) satellite data for year 2006. The result demonstrates the ability of the niche models in assessing the probable extent of Himalayan birch distribution and its presence in treeline ecotone of Uttarakhand and the technique could be further used for modeling future scenario of the alpine treeline in Indian Himalaya.","uuid":"807e9b5e-1ba6-33c4-906b-ea8f4df9f0fa","authors":[{"forename":"Chandra Prakash","surname":"Singh"},{"forename":"Sushma","surname":"Panigrahy"},{"forename":"J.

These problems are likely to intensify under future population growth and climate change scenarios. Scarce data on the distribution of freshwater fishes frequently limits the ability to assess the potential implications of an IBWT project on freshwater fish communities. Because connectivity in habitat networks is expected to be critical to species' biogeography, consideration of changes in the relative isolation of riverine networks may provide a strategy for controlling impacts of IBWTs on freshwater fish communities. Methods\/Principal Findings Using empirical data on the current patterns of freshwater fish biodiversity for rivers of peninsular India, we show here how the spatial changes alone under an archetypal IBWT project will (1) reduce freshwater fish biodiversity system-wide, (2) alter patterns of local species richness, (3) expand distributions of widespread species throughout peninsular rivers, and (4) decrease community richness by increasing inter-basin similarity (a mechanism for the observed decrease in biodiversity). Given the complexity of the IBWT, many paths to partial or full completion of the project are possible. We evaluate two strategies for step-wise implementation of the 11 canals, based on economic or ecological considerations. We find that for each step in the project, the impacts on freshwater fish communities are sensitive to which canal is added to the network. Conclusions\/Significance Importantly, ecological impacts can be reduced by associating the sequence in which canals are added to characteristics of the links, except for the case when all 11 canals are implemented simultaneously (at which point the sequence of canal addition is inconsequential). By identifying the fundamental relationship between the geometry of riverine networks and freshwater fish biodiversity, our results will aid in assessing impacts of IBWT projects and balancing ecosystem and societal demands for freshwater, even in cases where biodiversity data are limited.","uuid":"ec7c8cc2-6af0-3c03-940b-8d9aa4afb8ed","authors":[{"forename":"Evan H.

A related species, Dasia subcaeruleum, is re-described based on new material from a new locality in the Western Ghats. Mitochondrial rDNA-based phylogenetic analysis of the genus Dasia reveals the affin- ities of the south Indian and the Sri Lankan species with Southeast Asian ones. The biogeographic processes that might have led to the disjunct distribution of the entities in the genus are discussed. An updated key to the identification of species of the genus Dasia is provided.","uuid":"c6d5dc98-9485-3ee8-9289-280d7cb9e15e","authors":[{"forename":"S.","surname":"Harikrishnan"},{"forename":"Karthikeyan","surname":"Vasudevan"},{"forename":"Anslem De","surname":"Silva"},{"forename":"V.","surname":"Deepak"},{"forename":"Niladri Bhusan","surname":"Kar"},{"forename":"Rohit","surname":"Naniwadekar"},{"forename":"Albert","surname":"Lalremruata"},{"forename":"K.
