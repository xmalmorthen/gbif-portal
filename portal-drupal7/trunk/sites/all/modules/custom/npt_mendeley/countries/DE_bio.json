Their ecological drivers and geographical patterns, however, often remain a puzzle. Truffle species in Germany are classified as Very Rare or even Extinct on the national Red Lists, while historical literature described their sporadic existence. Here we present evidence of seven Tuber species (T. aestivum, T. brumale, T. excavatum, T. fulgens, T. macrosporum, T. mesentericum, T. rufum), discovered at 121 sites in Southwest Germany. The valuable Burgundy truffle (T. aestivum) occurred at 116 sites. An unexpected abundance of Tuber spp. associated with 13 potential host plants along wide ecological gradients in a region far outside the traditional Mediterranean truffle foci in France, Italy and Spain, is likely indicative of possible responses to climate change, and also suggests ample truffle cultivation potential north of the Alpine arc.","uuid":"481a3bfd-6599-35db-a408-55916110f0ea","authors":[{"forename":"Ulrich","surname":"Stobbe"},{"forename":"Ulf","surname":"Buntgen"},{"forename":"Ludger","surname":"Sproll"},{"forename":"Willy","surname":"Tegel"},{"forename":"Simon","surname":"Egli"},{"forename":"Siegfried","surname":"Fink"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Stobbe"}]
