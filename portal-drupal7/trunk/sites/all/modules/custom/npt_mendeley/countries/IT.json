An updated map of the species\u2019 distribution including the new Italian sites is presented and we provide evidence to support the idea that the current chorotype of N. alluaudi is the result of an association of the Saharan and Turanic-European-Mediterranean chorotypes.","uuid":"b359998e-88c3-3435-a2fc-11fed8607ae4","authors":[{"forename":"Giuseppe","surname":"Alfonso"},{"forename":"Genuario","surname":"Belmonte"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Alfonso"},{"id":"6104317794","title":"Will climate change promote future invasions?","type":"Journal Article","url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23913552","tags":["2013","Aichi_B","climate","FR","France","GBIF_used","GBIF_VIP","global_biodiversity","invasive","IT","Italy","NL","Target_9","The Netherlands"],"keywords":["climate change","invasive species","land use change","species distribution models"],"pages":"1-9","year":"2013","abstract":"Biological invasion is increasingly recognized as one of the greatest threats to biodiversity. Using ensemble forecasts from species distribution models to project future suitable areas of the 100 of the world's worst invasive species defined by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, we show that both climate and land use changes will likely cause drastic species range shifts. Looking at potential spatial aggregation of invasive species, we identify three future hotspots of invasion in Europe, northeastern North America, and Oceania. We also emphasize that some regions could lose a significant number of invasive alien species, creating opportunities for ecosystem restoration. From the list of 100, scenarios of potential range distributions show a consistent shrinking for invasive amphibians and birds, while for aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates distributions are projected to substantially increase in most cases. Given the harmful impacts these invasive species currently have on ecosystems, these species will likely dramatically influence the future of biodiversity.","uuid":"c8db55a4-6165-398c-a567-951085510470","authors":[{"forename":"Celine","surname":"Bellard"},{"forename":"Wilfried","surname":"Thuiller"},{"forename":"Boris","surname":"Leroy"},{"forename":"Piero","surname":"Genovesi"},{"forename":"Michel","surname":"Bakkenes"},{"forename":"Franck","surname":"Courchamp"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Bellard"},{"id":"6016483644","title":"The Flora of Chad: a checklist and brief analysis","type":"Journal Article","volume":"23","url":"http:\/\/www.pensoft.net\/journals\/phytokeys\/article\/4752\/abstract\/the-flora-of-chad-a-checklist-and-brief-analysis","tags":["2013","Aichi_E","Chad_biodiversity","GBIF_used","GBits_8","IT","Italy","plants","Target_19"],"keywords":["chad","checklist","flora","plant diversity"],"pages":"1-18","year":"2013","abstract":"A checklist of the flora of Chad has been compiled by the authors, based on literature, on-line data-bases, herbarium collections and land surveys (1998-2011).

We evaluated future distributions for the threatened European crayfish fauna in response to climate change, watershed boundaries, and the spread of invasive crayfishes, which transmit the crayfish plague, a lethal disease for native European crayfishes. We used climate projections from general circulation models and statistical models based on Mahalanobis distance to predict climate-suitable regions for native and invasive crayfishes in the middle and at the end of the 21st century. We identified these suitable regions as accessible or inaccessible on the basis of major watershed boundaries and present occurrences and evaluated potential future overlap with 3 invasive North American crayfishes. Climate-suitable areas decreased for native crayfishes by 19% to 72%, and the majority of future suitable areas for most of these species were inaccessible relative to native and current distributions. Overlap with invasive crayfish plague-transmitting species was predicted to increase. Some native crayfish species (e.g., noble crayfish [Astacus astacus]) had no future refugia that were unsuitable for the modeled nonnative species. Our results emphasize the importance of preventing additional introductions and spread of invasive crayfishes in Europe to minimize interactions between the multiple stressors of climate change and invasive species, while suggesting candidate regions for the debatable management option of assisted colonization.","uuid":"bb4f110b-8556-3948-961a-e4a8b8c4e3ee","authors":[{"forename":"C\u00e9sar","surname":"Capinha"},{"forename":"Eric R.","surname":"Larson"},{"forename":"Elena","surname":"Tricarico"},{"forename":"Julian D.","surname":"Olden"},{"forename":"Francesca","surname":"Gherardi"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Capinha"},{"id":"6016482594","title":"The Use of Climatic Niches in Screening Procedures for Introduced Species to Evaluate Risk of Spread: A Case with the American Eastern Grey Squirrel","type":"Journal Article","volume":"8","issue":"7","url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0066559","tags":["2013","Aichi_B","DE","GB","GBIF_used","GBIF_VIP","GBits_9","Germany","Globsl_biodiversity","invasive","IT","Italy","IUCN","Maxent","SDM","Target_9"],"keywords":[],"pages":"e66559","year":"2013","abstract":"Species introduction represents one of the most serious threats for biodiversity.

Maxent was used to develop three models: one considering only records from the native range (NRM), a second including records from native and invasive range (NIRM), a third calibrated with invasive occurrences and projected in the native range (RCM). Niche conservatism was tested considering both a niche equivalency and a niche similarity test. NRM failed to predict suitable parts of the currently invaded range in Europe, while RCM underestimated the suitability in the native range. NIRM accurately predicted both the native and invasive range. The niche equivalency hypothesis was rejected due to a significant difference between the grey squirrel\u2019s niche in native and invasive ranges. The niche similarity test yielded no significant results. Our analyses support the hypothesis of a shift in the species\u2019 climatic niche in the area of introductions.

As with any biological data, range maps have some level of measurement error, but this error is rarely quantified. We assessed the error associated with amphibian range maps by comparing them with point locality data. Location Global. Methods The maps published by the Global Amphibian Assessment were assessed against two data sets of species point localities: the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), and a refined data set including recently published, high-quality presence data from both GBIF and other sources. Range fit was measured as the proportion of presence records falling within the range polygon(s) for each species. Results Using the high-quality point data provided better fit measures than using the raw GBIF data. Range fit was highly variable among continents, being highest for North American and European species (a fit of 84\u201394%), and lowest for Asian and South American species (a fit of 57\u201364%). At the global scale, 95% of amphibian point records were inside the ranges published in maps, or within 31 km of the range edge. However, differences among continents were striking, and more points were found far from range edges for South American and Asian species. Main conclusions The Global Amphibian Assessment range maps represent the known distribution of most amphibians well; this study provides measures of accuracy that can be useful for future research using amphibian maps as baseline data. Nevertheless, there is a need for greater investment in the continuous updating and improvement of maps, particularly in the megadiverse areas of tropical Asia and South America.","uuid":"33db80ec-d3b8-329b-9de9-dc26bf808e8d","authors":[{"forename":"Gentile Francesco","surname":"Ficetola"},{"forename":"Carlo","surname":"Rondinini"},{"forename":"Anna","surname":"Bonardi"},{"forename":"Vineet","surname":"Katariya"},{"forename":"Emilio","surname":"Padoa-schioppa"},{"forename":"Ariadne","surname":"Angulo"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Journal of Biogeography","firstAuthor":"Ficetola"},{"id":"6016484234","title":"Evaluation of Online Information Sources on Alien Species in Europe: The Need of Harmonization and Integration.","type":"Journal Article","url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23609303","tags":["2013","Aichi_B","Europe_biodiversity","GBIF_used","GBIF_VIP","GBits_8","GR","Greece","informatics","invasive","in_press","IT","Italy","Target_9"],"keywords":["Biological invasions","European policy","Interoperable web services","Online databases","Standardization"],"year":"2013","abstract":"Europe is severely affected by alien invasions, which impact biodiversity, ecosystem services, economy, and human health.

In this study, we analyze the effects of a seemingly nonpermeable matrix on the population structure of the forest-dwelling butterfly Pararge aegeria in geographically isolated oases at the northern margin of the Sahara desert using microsatellites, morphological characters, and species distribution modeling. Results from all analyses are mostly congruent and reveal 1) a split between European and North African populations, 2) rather low divergence between populations from the eastern and western part of North Africa (Morocco vs. Tunisia), 3) a lack of differentiation between the oasis and Atlas Mountain populations, 4) as well as among the oasis populations, and 5) no reduction of genetic variability in oasis populations. However, one exception to this general trend resulted from the analyses of wing shape; wings of butterflies from oases are more elongated compared with those from the other habitats. This pattern of phenotypic divergence may suggest a recent colonization of the oasis habitats by individuals, which might be accompanied by a rather dispersive behavior. Species distribution modeling suggests a fairly recent reexpansion of the species' climatic niche starting in the Holocene at about 6000 before present. The combined results indicate a rather recent colonization of the oases by highly mobile individuals from genetically diverse founder populations. The colonization was likely followed by the expansion and persistence of these founder populations under relatively stable environmental conditions. This, together with low rates of gene flow, likely prevented differentiation of populations via drift and led to the maintenance of high genetic diversity.","uuid":"516480b9-c315-313a-8ae8-7aec2ff31bc6","authors":[{"forename":"Jan Christian","surname":"Habel"},{"forename":"Martin","surname":"Husemann"},{"forename":"Thomas","surname":"Schmitt"},{"forename":"Leonardo","surname":"Dapporto"},{"forename":"Dennis","surname":"R\u00f6dder"},{"forename":"Sofie","surname":"Vandewoestijne"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"The Journal of heredity","firstAuthor":"Habel"},{"id":"6016482904","title":"How many marine aliens in Europe?","type":"Journal Article","volume":"4","url":"http:\/\/www.reabic.net\/journals\/mbi\/2013\/Accepted\/MBI_2013_Katsanevakis_etal_correctedproof.pdf","tags":["2013","Aichi_B","Europe_biodiversity","GBIF_used","GR","Greece","invasive","in_press","IT","Italy","marine","Target_9","taxonomy"],"keywords":["biological invasions","easin","european seas","information system","non-indigenous species"],"year":"2013","uuid":"17c66a18-e93d-3794-a77d-7b95738ba99c","authors":[{"forename":"Stelios","surname":"Katsanevakis"},{"forename":"Francesca","surname":"Gatto"},{"forename":"Argyro","surname":"Zenetos"},{"forename":"Ana Cristina","surname":"Cardoso"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Management of Bioloigical Invasions","firstAuthor":"Katsanevakis"},{"id":"6140550094","title":"The 100th of the world\u2019s worst invasive alien species","type":"Journal Article","url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/10.1007\/s10530-013-0561-5","tags":["2013","Aichi_B","FR","France","GBIF_used","global_biodiversity","invasive","in_press","IT","Italy","Target_9","US"],"keywords":["biological invasions","ISSG","salvinia molesta"],"year":"2013","abstract":"Biological invasions are among the greatest threats to global biodiversity, but in contrast to most other global threats, they suffer from specific communication issues.

We first used mitochondrial and nuclear genetic markers to investigate the phylogeographic structure of the species and its Pleistocene history using coalescent-based methods; then we used species distribution modelling to infer the climatic niche of the species at last glacial maximum; finally, we reviewed the literature on the I. ricinus hosts to identify the locations of their glacial refugia. Our results support the scenario that during the last glacial phase, I. ricinus never experienced a prolonged allopatric divergence in separate glacial refugia, but persisted with interconnected populations across Southern and Central Europe. The generalist behaviour in host choice of I. ricinus would have played a major role in maintaining connections between its populations. Although most of the hosts persisted in separate refugia, from the point of view of I. ricinus, they represented a continuity of 'bridges' among populations. Our study highlights the importance of species-specific ecology in affecting responses to Pleistocene glacial-interglacial cycles. Together with other cases in Europe and elsewhere, it contributes to setting new hypotheses on how species with wide ecological plasticity coped with Pleistocene climatic changes.","uuid":"bf785ec9-b9ab-3ca8-a323-45ebb9acf13c","authors":[{"forename":"Daniele","surname":"Porretta"},{"forename":"Valentina","surname":"Mastrantonio"},{"forename":"Stefano","surname":"Mona"},{"forename":"Sara","surname":"Epis"},{"forename":"Matteo","surname":"Montagna"},{"forename":"Davide","surname":"Sassera"},{"forename":"Claudio","surname":"Bandi"},{"forename":"Sandra","surname":"Urbanelli"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Molecular ecology","firstAuthor":"Porretta"},{"id":"6016484594","title":"Vulnerability of artisanal fisheries to climate change in the Venice Lagoon","type":"Journal Article","volume":"2012","url":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/jfb.12124","tags":["2013","Aichi_B","GBIF_primary","GBIF_used","GBits_9","in_press","IT","Italy","Italy_biodiversity","marine","target_7"],"keywords":["global changes","landings","northern adriatic sea","small-scale fishery","temperature","time"],"year":"2013","abstract":"Within the context of global warming, the western coast of the northern Adriatic Sea can be regarded as an extremely vulnerable area. Owing to the local geographic features, this area has been described as the Venetian lacuna, where Mediterranean Sea climatic conditions are replaced by Atlantic Ocean ones, supporting the presence of glacial relicts, such as sprat Sprattus sprattus, flounder Platichthys flesus and brown shrimp Crangon crangon. Nektonic assemblage therefore represents a good candidate in terms of an early proxy for thermal regime alterations. It represents a dynamic component of the lagoon ecosystem, changing in space and time, actively moving through the entire system, and dynamically exchanging with the open sea. Here, the first signals of the change have been already detected, such as the presence of alien thermophilic species. Within this context, since the beginning of the century, sampling of the nektonic assemblage has been carried out, integrating them with landings data from the fish market. Vulnerabilities to thermal regime changes have been tested by (1) categorizing species according to the mean distribution area in terms of latitudinal range (over 45\u25e6,30\u25e6\u201345\u25e6 and below 30\u25e6), and (2) analysing both spatial and temporal variations within fishing grounds. Results indicated a high potential vulner- ability of the artisanal fishery to climate change, as the commercial catch is entirely composed of species from cold (>45\u25e6 N) and temperate (between 45\u25e6 and 30\u25e6 N) latitudes.

Invasive alien species (IAS) constitute a major pressure in many aquatic ecosystems, yet are not explicitly accounted for by the majority of WFD assessment methods. Most Member States argue that no explicit assessment of IAS is required, assuming that significant IAS pressures will affect the WFD biological quality elements (BQEs), and be detected by generic WFD status assessments. We tested this assumption for a selection of country-by-surface-water category combinations, covering nearly 40,000 water bodies. For each of the combinations, the pressure by high-impact IAS is higher in water bodies with ecological status varying from bad to moderate than in water bodies in good or high ecological status. Most high-impact IAS show strong associations with low status class categories. Of the 17 most frequently occurring high-impact IAS, only Mustela vison (Schreber, 1777) and Potamopyrgus antipodarum (Gray, 1853) are disproportionately frequent in high status water bodies. The sensitivity of WFD methods varies across BQEs, with macrophyte-based methods showing a consistently high sensitivity to IAS pressures. However, significant pressures are observed in a number of high status water bodies. This points to a need for further optimization of existing methods so that they address the full range of pressures exerted by IAS.","uuid":"b44f0a06-8d39-3c61-acd0-eb5874aa4e53","authors":[{"forename":"Jochen","surname":"Vandekerkhove"},{"forename":"Ana Cristina","surname":"Cardoso"},{"forename":"Philip J.","surname":"Boon"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Vandekerkhove"},{"id":"6016484214","title":"Radically different phylogeographies and patterns of genetic variation in two European brown frogs, genus Rana.","type":"Journal Article","issue":"May","url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23632031","tags":["2013","Aichi_E","Croatia","DE","ES","Europe_biodiversity","FR","France","GB","GBIF_used","GBits_8","Germany","GR","Greece","HR","in_press","IT","Italy","PL","Poland","Portugal","PT","RU","Russia","Spain","Target_19","UA","Ukraine"],"keywords":[],"year":"2013","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","abstract":"We reconstruct range-wide phylogeographies of two widespread and largely co-occurring Western Palearctic frogs, Rana temporaria and R. dalmatina.

The two focal species differ radically in their phylogeographic structure, with R. temporaria being strongly variable among and within populations, and R. dalmatina homogeneous across Europe with a single strongly differentiated population in southern Italy. These differences were observed across the various markers studied, including microsatellites and SNP density, but especially in protein-coding nuclear genes where R. dalmatina had extremely low heterozygosity values across its range, including potential refugial areas, whereas R. temporaria had comparably high range-wide values, including many areas of probable postglacial colonization. A phylogeny of R. temporaria based on various concatenated mtDNA genes revealed that two haplotype clades endemic to Iberia form a paraphyletic group at the base of the cladogram, and all other haplotypes form a monophyletic group, in agreement with an Iberian origin of the species. Demographic analysis suggests that R. temporaria and R. dalmatina have genealogies of roughly the same time to coalescence (TMRCA \u223c3.5 mya for both species), but R. temporaria might have been been characterized by larger ancestral and current effective population sizes than R. dalmatina. The unusually high genetic variation in R. temporaria can therefore be explained by its early range expansion out of Iberia, with subsequent cycles of differentiation in cryptic glacial refugial areas followed by admixture, while the range expansion of R. dalmatina into central Europe is a more recent event.","uuid":"b330f971-716c-3e23-9946-69d5abe1d745","authors":[{"forename":"Miguel","surname":"Vences"},{"forename":"J","surname":"Susanne Hauswaldt"},{"forename":"Sebastian","surname":"Steinfartz"},{"forename":"Oliver","surname":"Rupp"},{"forename":"Alexander","surname":"Goesmann"},{"forename":"Sven","surname":"K\u00fcnzel"},{"forename":"Pablo","surname":"Orozco-Terwengel"},{"forename":"David R","surname":"Vieites"},{"forename":"Sandra","surname":"Nieto-Roman"},{"forename":"Sabrina","surname":"Haas"},{"forename":"Clara","surname":"Laugsch"},{"forename":"Marcelo","surname":"Gehara"},{"forename":"Sebastian","surname":"Bruchmann"},{"forename":"Maciej","surname":"Pabijan"},{"forename":"Ann-Kathrin","surname":"Ludewig"},{"forename":"Dirk","surname":"Rudert"},{"forename":"Claudio","surname":"Angelini"},{"forename":"Leo J.","surname":"Borkin"},{"forename":"Pierre-Andr\u00e9","surname":"Crochet"},{"forename":"Angelica","surname":"Crottini"},{"forename":"Alain","surname":"Dubois"},{"forename":"G.","surname":"Francesco Ficetola"},{"forename":"Pedro","surname":"Gal\u00e1n"},{"forename":"Philippe","surname":"Geniez"},{"forename":"Monika","surname":"Hachtel"},{"forename":"Olga","surname":"Jovanovic"},{"forename":"Spartak N.","surname":"Litvinchuk"},{"forename":"Petros","surname":"Lymberakis"},{"forename":"Annemarie","surname":"Ohler"},{"forename":"Nazar A.","surname":"Smirnov"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Molecular phylogenetics and evolution","firstAuthor":"Vences"},{"id":"6016483064","title":"Conservation Priorities for Prunus africana Defined with the Aid of Spatial Analysis of Genetic Data and Climatic Variables","type":"Journal Article","volume":"8","issue":"3","url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0059987","tags":["2013","Africa_biodiversity","Aichi_C","Aichi_E","AT","Austria","BE","Belgium","Bioversity","CO","Colombia","conservation","GBIF_used","GBits_8","IT","Italy","KE","Kenya","Maxent","plants","SDM","Target_12","Target_18"],"keywords":[],"pages":"e59987","year":"2013","abstract":"Conservation priorities for Prunus africana, a tree species found across Afromontane regions, which is of great commercial interest internationally and of local value for rural communities, were defined with the aid of spatial analyses applied to a set of georeferenced molecular marker data (chloroplast and nuclear microsatellites) from 32 populations in 9 African countries. Two approaches for the selection of priority populations for conservation were used, differing in the way they optimize representation of intra-specific diversity of P. africana across a minimum number of populations. The first method (S1) was aimed at maximizing genetic diversity of the conservation units and their distinctiveness with regard to climatic conditions, the second method (S2) at optimizing representativeness of the genetic diversity found throughout the species\u2019 range. Populations in East African countries (especially Kenya and Tanzania) were found to be of great conservation value, as suggested by previous findings. These populations are complemented by those in Madagascar and Cameroon. The combination of the two methods for prioritization led to the identification of a set of 6 priority populations. The potential distribution of P. africana was then modeled based on a dataset of 1,500 georeferenced observations. This enabled an assessment of whether the priority populations identified are exposed to threats from agricultural expansion and climate change, and whether they are located within the boundaries of protected areas. The range of the species has been affected by past climate change and the modeled distribution of P. africana indicates that the species is likely to be negatively affected in future, with an expected decrease in distribution by 2050. Based on these insights, further research at the regional and national scale is recommended, in order to strengthen P. africana conservation efforts.","uuid":"94835341-933e-324a-9094-680d017f9471","authors":[{"forename":"Barbara","surname":"Vinceti"},{"forename":"Judy","surname":"Loo"},{"forename":"Hannes","surname":"Gaisberger"},{"forename":"Maarten J.","surname":"van Zonneveld"},{"forename":"Silvio","surname":"Schueler"},{"forename":"Heino","surname":"Konrad"},{"forename":"Caroline a.

First, it is hypothesized that the origin and development of the Central Asian Deserts generated a biogeographic barrier that fragmented past continuous distributions in Eastern and Western domains. Second, Pleistocene glaciations have been proposed as the main process driving the regional diversification within each of these domains. The European common toad and its closest relatives provide an interesting opportunity to examine the relative contributions of these paleogeographic and paleoclimatic events to the phylogeny and biogeography of a widespread Eurasiatic group. We investigate this issue by applying a multiproxy approach combining information from molecular phylogenies, a multiple correspondence analysis of allozyme data and species distribution models. Our study includes 304 specimens from 164 populations, covering most of the distributional range of the Bufo bufo species complex in the Western Palearctic. The phylogenies (ML and Bayesian analyses) were based on a total of 1988 bp of mitochondrial DNA encompassing three genes (tRNAval, 16S and ND1). A dataset with 173 species of the family Bufonidae was assembled to estimate the separation of the two pan-Eurasiatic species complexes of Bufo and to date the main biogeographic events within the Bufo bufo species complex. The allozyme study included sixteen protein systems, corresponding to 21 presumptive loci. Finally, the distribution models were based on maximum entropy. Our distribution models show that Eastern and Western species complexes are greatly isolated by the Central Asian Deserts, and our dating estimates place this divergence during the Middle Miocene, a moment in which different sources of evidence document a major upturn of the aridification rate of Central Asia. This climate-driven process likely separated the Eastern and Western species. At the level of the Western Palearctic, our dating estimates place most of the deepest phylogenetic structure before the Pleistocene, indicating that Pleistocene glaciations did not have a major role in splitting the major lineages. At a shallow level, the glacial dynamics contributed unevenly to the genetic structuring of populations, with a strong influence in the European-Caucasian populations, and a more relaxed effect in the Iberian populations.","uuid":"ed940d5e-18f9-36a6-afb1-e127807288cd","authors":[{"forename":"J.","surname":"Garcia-Porta"},{"forename":"S.

Although this modern invasion has been the focus of many studies, the history of the species\u2019 native populations remains poorly understood. Here, we aimed to assess the role of Pleistocene climatic changes in shaping the current distribution of the species in its native range. Methodology\/Principal Findings We investigated the phylogeography, historical demography, and species distribution of Ae. albopictus native populations at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Individuals from 16 localities from East Asia were analyzed for sequence variation at two mitochondrial genes. No phylogeographic structure was observed across the study area. Demographic analyses showed a signature of population expansion that started roughly 70,000 years BP. The occurrence of a continuous and climatically suitable area comprising Southeast China, Indochinese Peninsula, and Sundaland during LGM was indicated by species distribution modelling. Conclusions\/Significance Our results suggest an evolutionary scenario in which, during the last glacial phase, Ae. albopictus did not experience a fragmentation phase but rather persisted in interconnected populations and experienced demographic growth. The wide ecological flexibility of the species probably played a crucial role in its response to glacial-induced environmental changes. Currently, there is little information on the impact of Pleistocene climatic changes on animal species in East Asia. Most of the studies focused on forest-associated species and suggested cycles of glacial fragmentation and post-glacial expansion. The case of Ae. albopictus, which exhibits a pattern not previously observed in the study area, adds an important piece to our understanding of the Pleistocene history of East Asian biota.","uuid":"5db8f43d-aab4-3875-b0eb-b63a12ad3646","authors":[{"forename":"Daniele","surname":"Porretta"},{"forename":"Valentina","surname":"Mastrantonio"},{"forename":"Romeo","surname":"Bellini"},{"forename":"Pradya","surname":"Somboon"},{"forename":"Sandra","surname":"Urbanelli"}],"editors":[{"forename":"Luciano A.","surname":"Moreira"}],"publication_outlet":"PLoS ONE","firstAuthor":"Porretta"},{"id":"6016483314","title":"Recent phylogeographic structure in a widespread \u2018weedy\u2019 Neotropical tree species, Cordia alliodora (Boraginaceae)","type":"Journal Article","volume":"online","url":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/j.1365-2699.2012.02727.x","tags":["2012","Aichi_E","AU","Australia","GB","GBIF_used","in_press","IT","Italy","PA","Panama","phylogeography","Smithsonian","Target_19","university","University of Oxford","US"],"keywords":["amazon basin","andes mountains","correspondence","hawkesbury","neotropics","paul d","phylogeography","rymer","samova","structure","tropical trees","vicariance"],"pages":"no-no","year":"2012","abstract":"Aim Although hundreds of tree species have broad geographic ranges in the Neotropics, little is known about how such widespread species attained disjunct distributions around mountain, ocean and xeric barriers. Here, we examine the phylogeographic structure of a widespread and economically important tree, Cordia alliodora, to: (1) test the roles of vicariance and dispersal in establishing major range disjunctions, (2) determine which geographic regions and\/or habitats contain the highest levels of genetic diversity, and (3) infer the geographic origin of the species. Location: Twenty-five countries in Central and South America, and the West Indies. Methods: Chloroplast simple sequence repeats (cpSSR; eight loci) were assayed in 67 populations (240 individuals) sampled from the full geographic range of C. alliodora. Chloroplast (trnH\u2013psbA) and nuclear (internal transcribed spacer, ITS) DNA sequences were sampled from a geographically representative subset. Genetic structure was determined with samova, structure and haplotype networks. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) and rarefaction analyses were used to compare regional haplotype diversity and differentiation. Results Although the ITS region was polymorphic it revealed limited phylogeographic structure, and trnH\u2013psbA was monomorphic. However, structure analysis of cpSSR variation recovered three broad demes spanning Central America (Deme 1), the Greater Antilles and the Choc\u00f3 (Deme 2), and the Lesser Antilles and cis-Andean South America (Deme 3). samova showed two predominant demes (Deme 1 + 2 and Deme 3). The greatest haplotype diversity was detected east of the Andes, while significantly more genetic variation was partitioned among trans-Andean populations. Populations experiencing high precipitation seasonality (dry ecotype) had greater levels of genetic variation. Main conclusions Cordia alliodora displayed weak cis- and trans-Andean phylogeographic structure based on DNA sequence data, indicative of historical dispersal around this barrier and genetic exchange across its broad range. The cpSSR data revealed phylogeographic structure corresponding to three biogeographic zones. Patterns of genetic diversity are indicative of an origin in the seasonally dry habitats of South America. Therefore, C. alliodora fits the disperser hypothesis for widespread Neotropical species. Dispersal is evident in the West Indies and the northern Andean cordilleras. The dry ecotype harbours genetic variation that is likely to represent the source for the establishment of populations under future warmer and drier climatic scenarios.","uuid":"b6f163af-a513-3bc1-acfb-e8fc76d5e1b7","authors":[{"forename":"Paul D.","surname":"Rymer"},{"forename":"Christopher W.","surname":"Dick"},{"forename":"Giovanni G.","surname":"Vendramin"},{"forename":"Anna","surname":"Buonamici"},{"forename":"David","surname":"Boshier"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Journal of Biogeography","firstAuthor":"Rymer"},{"id":"6016484094","title":"Present Spatial Diversity Patterns of Theobroma cacao L. in the Neotropics Reflect Genetic Differentiation in Pleistocene Refugia Followed by Human-Influenced Dispersal","type":"Journal Article","volume":"7","issue":"10","url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0047676","tags":["2012","agriculture","Aichi_C","BE","Belgium","Bioversity","Central America_biodiversity","CO","Colombia","GBIF_used","IT","Italy","plants","South America_biodiversity","Target_13"],"keywords":[],"pages":"e47676","year":"2012","abstract":"Cacao (Theobroma cacao L.) is indigenous to the Amazon basin, but is generally believed to have been domesticated in Mesoamerica for the production of chocolate beverage. However, cacao\u2019s distribution of genetic diversity in South America is also likely to reflect pre-Columbian human influences that were superimposed on natural processes of genetic differentiation. Here we present the results of a spatial analysis of the intra-specific diversity of cacao in Latin America, drawing on a dataset of 939 cacao trees genotypically characterized by means of 96 SSR markers. To assess continental diversity patterns we performed grid-based calculations of allelic richness, Shannon diversity and Nei gene diversity, and distinguished different spatially coherent genetic groups by means of cluster analysis. The highest levels of genetic diversity were observed in the Upper Amazon areas from southern Peru to the Ecuadorian Amazon and the border areas between Colombia, Peru and Brazil. On the assumption that the last glaciation (22,000\u201313,000 BP) had the greatest pre-human impact on the current distribution and diversity of cacao, we modeled the species\u2019 Pleistocene niche suitability and overlaid this with present-day diversity maps. The results suggest that cacao was already widely distributed in the Western Amazon before the onset of glaciation. During glaciations, cacao populations were likely to have been restricted to several refugia where they probably underwent genetic differentiation, resulting in a number of genetic clusters which are representative for, or closest related to, the original wild cacao populations. The analyses also suggested that genetic differentiation and geographical distribution of a number of other clusters seem to have been significantly affected by processes of human management and accompanying genetic bottlenecks. We discuss the implications of these results for future germplasm collection and in situ, on farm and ex situ conservation of cacao.","uuid":"321c88a7-d478-3413-8d9f-6091c8d0b747","authors":[{"forename":"Evert","surname":"Thomas"},{"forename":"Maarten van","surname":"Zonneveld"},{"forename":"Judy","surname":"Loo"},{"forename":"Toby","surname":"Hodgkin"},{"forename":"Gea","surname":"Galluzzi"},{"forename":"Jacob van","surname":"Etten"}],"editors":[{"forename":"Dorian Q.","surname":"Fuller"}],"publication_outlet":"PLoS ONE","firstAuthor":"Thomas"},{"id":"6016481364","title":"Mitochondrial phylogeography of the Holarctic Parnassius phoebus complex supports a recent refugial model for alpine butterflies","type":"Journal Article","volume":"39","issue":"6","url":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/j.1365-2699.2011.02675.x","tags":["2012","Aichi_E","CA","Canada","conservation","ecology","FI","Finland","GB","GBIF_used","Global_biodiversity","IT","Italy","niche_modeling","SDM","Target_19","university"],"keywords":["Alpine butterflies","coalescent","correspondence","glacial cycles","holarctic","mtDNA","Parnassius","phylogeography","substitution rates","valentina todisco"],"pages":"1058-1072","year":"2012","abstract":"the Holarctic distribution of the P. phoebus complex. A global species distribution model (SDM) was calculated by the maximum entropy (Maxent) approach, allowing assignment of samples into geographically consistent \u2018operational\u2019 units. Phylogenetic and coalescent methods were applied to describe the global mitogenetic structure and estimate population genetics parameters. Geological and palaeoecological evidence was used for internal calibration and validation of a COI substitution rate. Results Eurasian (including Alaskan) and North American populations form two distinct mitochondrial clades. The mitochondrial time to most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) of the North American clade was estimated at less than 125 ka, and the TMRCA of the Eurasian\u2013Alaskan clade at less than 80 ka, except for a single divergent sequence from Mongolia. Pairwise divergence times between all geographical units within each continent date well within the last 100 ka, and most likely, the last 50\u201310 ka. Main conclusions In contrast with its currently scattered distribution within each of Eurasia and North America, the mitogenetic structure of the P. phoebus complex in both continents is shallow and weak, and shows no evidence of geographical structure dating back earlier than the last glacial cycle. We argue that mtDNA data are consistent with recent range expansion across each of the two continents and with persistent glacial long-range gene flow which ceased during the Holocene. We propose that P. phoebus may represent a model for Holarctic alpine invertebrates with moderate dispersal abilities in that its genetic structure at a continental scale reflects extensive connectivity during the most recent glacial phases.","uuid":"7b50e402-91f5-3069-a0f8-bae8acd29881","authors":[{"forename":"Valentina","surname":"Todisco"},{"forename":"Paolo","surname":"Gratton"},{"forename":"Evgeny V.","surname":"Zakharov"},{"forename":"Christopher W.","surname":"Wheat"},{"forename":"Valerio","surname":"Sbordoni"},{"forename":"Felix A.H.","surname":"Sperling"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Todisco"},{"id":"6016478974","title":"What spatial data do we need to develop global mammal conservation strategies?","type":"Journal Article","volume":"366","issue":"1578","url":"http:\/\/rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org\/cgi\/doi\/10.1098\/rstb.2011.0117","tags":["2011","AU","Australia","CH","conservation","GBIF_used","GBIF_VIP","IT","Italy","IUCN Red List","Switzerland","university"],"keywords":["geographical range","habitat suitability model","point locations","species distribution","species distribution model","species records"],"pages":"2623-2632","year":"2011","abstract":"Spatial data on species distributions are available in two main forms, point locations and distri- bution maps (polygon ranges and grids).

Large user communities are generating significant amounts of valuable environmental observations at local and regional scales using the devices and services of the Future Internet. These communities\u2019 environmental observations represent a wealth of information which is currently hardly used or used only in isolation and therefore in need of integration with other information sources. Indeed, this very integration will lead to a paradigm shift from a mere Sensor Web to an Observation Web with semantically enriched content emanating from sensors, environmental simulations and citizens. The paper also describes the research challenges to realize the Observation Web and the associated environmental enablers for the Future Internet. Such an environmental enabler could for instance be an electronic sensing device, a web-service application, or even a social networking group affording or facilitating the capability of the Future Internet applications to consume, produce, and use environmental observations in cross-domain applications. The term \u2015envirofied\u2016 Future Internet is coined to describe this overall target that forms a cornerstone of work in the Environmental Usage Area within the Future Internet PPP program. Relevant trends described in the paper are the usage of ubiquitous sensors (anywhere), the provision and generation of information by citizens, and the convergence of real and virtual realities to convey understanding of environmental observations. The paper addresses the technical challenges in the Environmental Usage Area and the need for designing multi-style service oriented architecture. Key topics are the mapping of requirements to capabilities, providing scalability and robustness with implementing context aware information retrieval. Another essential research topic is handling data fusion and model based computation, and the related propagation of information uncertainty. Approaches to security, standardization and harmonization, all essential for sustainable solutions, are summarized from the perspective of the Environmental Usage Area. The paper concludes with an overview of emerging, high impact applications in the environmental areas concerning land ecosystems (biodiversity), air quality (atmospheric conditions) and water ecosystems (marine asset management).","uuid":"7add5e71-bdbc-3824-ab74-998a2414de84","authors":[{"forename":"Denis","surname":"Havlik"},{"forename":"Sven","surname":"Schade"},{"forename":"Zoheir A.","surname":"Sabeur"},{"forename":"Paolo","surname":"Mazzetti"},{"forename":"Kym","surname":"Watson"},{"forename":"Arne J.","surname":"Berre"},{"forename":"Jose Lorenzo","surname":"Mon"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Havlik"},{"id":"6016479404","title":"The future of terrestrial mammals in the Mediterranean basin under climate change","type":"Journal Article","volume":"366","issue":"1578","url":"http:\/\/www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov\/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3140741&tool=pmcentrez&rendertype=abstract","tags":["2011","CH","climate","conservation","GBIF_used","GBIF_VIP","IT","Italy","IUCN Red List","Switzerland","university"],"keywords":["climate change","ensemble modelling","extinction risk","species distribution models"],"pages":"2681-2692","year":"2011","abstract":"The Mediterranean basin is considered a hotspot of biological diversity with a long history of modification of natural ecosystems by human activities, and is one of the regions that will face extensive changes in climate.

Out of 36 cultivated inland valleys visited across Benin, eight were found to be infested with Rhamphicarpa. Out of nine inland valleys inspected in 1998, Rhamphicarpa was found in five in 2007, compared with only three in 1998. Farmers estimated Rham- phicarpa-inflicted yield losses could exceed 60% and indicated that heavily infested fields are abandoned. In a pot experiment with a wide infestation range, the popular cultivar Gambiaka, combining resistance with sensitivity, showed a mean relative yield loss (RYL) of 63%. Parasitic Rhamphicarpa biomass (PRB), the difference between the above-ground biomass produced with and without a host, was suggested as indicator for infection level of this facultative parasite and hence as a practical measure for host resis- tance. Genetic variation in resistance and tolerance levels was observed among rice cultivars, but fertilizer applications significantly reduced parasite numbers, biomass and effects, cancelling out such genotypic differences. Depending on the tolerance level of the cultivars, the PRB only accounted for 3.7 e38.8% of the average parasite-inflicted host biomass reductions, indicating phytotoxic effects of Rhamphicarpa infection. R. fistulosa is an apparently increasing constraint to rain-fed lowland rice in Benin, threatening rice production in the wider region. The use of resistant and tolerant cultivars, combined with fertilizer applications could reduce Rhamphicarpa infections and mitigate negative effects on rice yields.","uuid":"5b130b42-5e5e-3c33-a2c9-4a36665d1fd5","authors":[{"forename":"Jonne","surname":"Rodenburg"},{"forename":"Norliette","surname":"Zossou-Kouderin"},{"forename":"Gualbert","surname":"Gb\u00e8hounou"},{"forename":"Adam","surname":"Ahanchede"},{"forename":"Amadou","surname":"Tour\u00e9"},{"forename":"Gerald","surname":"Kyalo"},{"forename":"Paul","surname":"Kiepe"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Crop Protection","firstAuthor":"Rodenburg"},{"id":"6016479364","title":"Predicting potential distribution of the jaguar (Panthera onca) in Mexico: identification of priority areas for conservation","type":"Journal Article","volume":"17","issue":"2","url":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/j.1472-4642.2010.00740.x","tags":["2011","CH","conservation","GBIF_used","IT","Italy","mammals","Mexico","Mexico_biodiversity","MX","niche_modeling","SDM","Switzerland","university"],"keywords":["Consensus methods","ENFA","ensemble model","GBIF_VIP","jaguar conservation","Mahalanobis Distance","Maxent"],"pages":"350-361","year":"2011","abstract":"Aim The jaguar, Panthera onca, is a species of global conservation concern.

Citizens can be involved, contributing to the collection of data, thus decreasing costs. Underwater research requires specialist skills and SCUBA certification, and it can be difficult to involve volunteers. The aim of this study was to involve large numbers of recreational divers in marine biodiversity monitoring for increasing the environmental education of the public and collecting data on the status of marine biodiversity. Here we show that thousands of recreational divers can be enrolled in a short time. Using specially formulated questionnaires, nonspecialist volunteers reported the presence of 61 marine taxa encountered during recreational dives, performed as regular sport dives. Validation trials were carried out to assess the accuracy and consistency of volunteer-recorded data, and these were compared to reference data collected by an experienced researcher. In the majority of trials (76%) volunteers performed with an accuracy and consistency of 50\u201380%, comparable to the performance of conservation volunteer divers on precise transects in other projects. The recruitment of recreational divers involved the main diving and tour operators in Italy, a popular scientific magazine, and mass media. During the four-year study, 3825 divers completed 18 757 questionnaires, corresponding to 13 539 diving hours. The volunteer- sightings-based index showed that in the monitored area the biodiversity status did not change significantly within the project time scale, but there was a significant negative correlation with latitude, suggesting improved quality in the southernmost areas. This trend could be related to the presence of stressors in the northern areas and has been supported by investigations performed by the Italian Ministry of the Environment. The greatest limitation with using volunteers to collect data was the uneven spatial distribution of samples. The benefits were the considerable amounts of data collected over short time periods and at low costs. The successful development of citizen-based monitoring programs requires open-mindedness in the academic community; advantages of citizen involvement in research are not only adding large data sets to the ecological knowledge base but also aiding in the environmental education of the public.","uuid":"3fcd9a4d-2653-3eaa-bc9f-92c174b178cd","authors":[{"forename":"Stefano","surname":"Goffredo"},{"forename":"Francesco","surname":"Pensa"},{"forename":"Patrizia","surname":"Neri"},{"forename":"Antonio","surname":"Orlandi"},{"forename":"Maria Scola","surname":"Gagliardi"},{"forename":"Angela","surname":"Velardi"},{"forename":"Corrado","surname":"Piccinetti"},{"forename":"Francesco","surname":"Zaccanti"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Ecological applications : a publication of the Ecological Society of America","firstAuthor":"Goffredo"},{"id":"6016476194","title":"Strong genetic cohesiveness between Italy and North Africa in four butterfly species","type":"Journal Article","volume":"99","url":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/j.1095-8312.2010.01394.x","tags":["2010","DE","GBIF_used","genetics","Germany","IT","Italy","LU","Luxembourg","museum","niche_modeling","research institute","SDM","species distribution","university"],"keywords":["allozyme electrophoresis","gene flow","genetic differentiation","isolation","Lycaena phlaeas","Maniola jurtina","Polyommatus icarus","Pyronia cecilia","species distribution modelling"],"pages":"818-830","year":"2010","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","abstract":"The sea acts as an effective dispersal barrier for most terrestrial animal species. Narrow sea straits, therefore, often represent areas where species are able to disperse from one land mass to another. In the Mediterranean Sea, the narrowest connecting points between North Africa and Europe are the Strait of Gibraltar and the Strait of Sicily. In the past, climatic oscillations caused changing sea levels and thus influenced the permeability of these sea straits. We analysed the genetic structure of four butterfly species that all occur on both sides of the Strait of Sicily. In all four species, we observed a lack of genetic differentiation between the populations of North Africa and those of Italy. Species distribution models support the strong cohesiveness in that they show a largely continuous glacial distribution over Italy and North Africa. The data obtained reveal that there was a large exchange of individuals between Italy and the eastern Maghreb during the last ice age. This might not only be the case for the species under investigation in the present study, but also might represent a more general pattern for mobile thermophilic western Palearctic species. \u00a9 2010 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2010, 99, 818\u2013830.","uuid":"8acc596d-39f9-3da4-890a-7546b9896038","authors":[{"forename":"Jan Christian","surname":"Habel"},{"forename":"Dennis","surname":"R\u00f6dder"},{"forename":"Scalercio","surname":"Stefano"},{"forename":"Marc","surname":"Meyer"},{"forename":"Thomas","surname":"Schmitt"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Habel"},{"id":"6016477404","title":"Pollination Syndromes in Mediterranean Orchids\u2014Implications for Speciation, Taxonomy and Conservation","type":"Journal Article","volume":"76","issue":"2","url":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/s12229-010-9049-5","tags":["2010","BE","Belgium","GBIF_used","IL","Israel","IT","Italy","taxonomy"],"keywords":["Life Sciences"],"pages":"220-240","year":"2010","publisher":"Springer New York","abstract":"The Mediterranean flora is spectacularly rich in orchid species that have evolved remarkable adaptations to their environment. Orchids have complex and delicate interactions with their pollinators, which makes them particularly prone to local extinction. Conservation actions should be encouraged for a range of endangered Mediterranean orchid species, but the current taxonomic confusion in several genera and the apparent disagreement among orchid taxonomists make the situation particularly confusing from a conservation perspective. In this review, we document how the different pollination syndromes of Mediterranean orchids (nectar reward, shelter offering, food deception and sexual deception) can have a profound impact on the type of reproductive barriers among species, on floral phenotypic variation as we perceive it, on potentially related processes of species sorting and extinction and, consequently, should have a strong influence on the related conservation management programs. We also highlight that the majority of Mediterranean orchids are pollinated by specialised bees often occupying otherwise narrow ecological niches (e.g. pollen specialisation, brood cell parasites, specific nesting site). This condition makes the orchid-pollinator interactions very fragile and several orchid species prone to local extinction. We illustrate this phenomenon by a selection of case studies that show how the adequate integration of the ecological requirements\/traits of the orchids and their associated pollinators into conservation actions could help protect endangered species and ensure the sustainability of the often complex local pollination web.","uuid":"10a57252-8d3b-3225-b0f3-73b4c01d844b","authors":[{"forename":"Nicolas","surname":"Vereecken"},{"forename":"Amots","surname":"Dafni"},{"forename":"Salvatore","surname":"Cozzolino"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"The Botanical Review","firstAuthor":"Vereecken"}]
