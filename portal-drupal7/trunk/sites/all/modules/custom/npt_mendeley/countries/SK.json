This find represents a newaddition to the fern flora of Europe. It is probably the result of long-distance spore dispersal. The nearest known sites for this species are those in eastern North America, about 6500km away. The important determina- tion characters of A. platyneuron are described, the Slovakian locality characterized and an over- view of the ecology and a map of the worldwide distribution of this species provided.","uuid":"f5c08b20-4610-30d1-8b0f-af9f82079c1b","authors":[{"forename":"Libor","surname":"Ekrt"},{"forename":"Richard","surname":"Hrivn\u00e1k"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Preslia","firstAuthor":"Ekrt"}]
