However, the zoogeographical affinities of several taxa from South America and Antarctica have been subject to debate, bringing into question the extent of Antarctic isolation. Here we present new data on bryozoan species and their spatial distribution in the Argentine Patagonian (AP) region, as well as an analysis of the bryozoological similarities between deep ranges from Argentina and neighbouring regions. A total of 108 species of cheilostome bryozoans (378 samples), belonging to 59 genera was found. Five new genera and 36 new species were found in the AP region, while 71 species were reported for the first time from Argentina. The bathymetric ranges of 94 species (87 %) were expanded and a high proportion of the identified species (44.4 %) also had an Antarctic distribution. The bryozoological affinities found in the current study between the nearest geographical neighbours are in agreement with the hypothesis of the sequential separation of Gondwana during the Cenozoic. Moreover, a high number of shared species, mainly from the slope, were found in this study between the AP region and Antarctica, thus supporting the idea that the Southern Ocean may have been less isolated over geological time than once thought.","uuid":"55508308-1753-3858-b15a-ade027d5bad0","authors":[{"forename":"Blanca","surname":"Figuerola"},{"forename":"Dennis P.","surname":"Gordon"},{"forename":"Virginia","surname":"Polonio"},{"forename":"Javier","surname":"Cristobo"},{"forename":"Conxita","surname":"Avila"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Figuerola"},{"id":"6016481904","title":"Balancing bioenergy and biosecurity policies: estimating current and future climate suitability patterns for a bioenergy crop","type":"Journal Article","url":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/gcbb.12068","tags":["2013","agriculture","AU","Australia","Australia_biodiversity","CLIMEX","CSIRO","GBIF_used","GBIF_VIP","GBits_8","in_press","SDM"],"keywords":["biosecurity","climex","invasive alien species","millettia pinnata","niche model","oilseed tree","pongamia pinnata"],"year":"2013","abstract":"In an apparent paradox, bioenergy crops offer potential benefits to a world adjusting to the challenges of climate change and declining fossil fuel stocks, as well as potential ecological and economic threats resulting from biological invasions. In considering this paradox it is important to understand that benefits and threats may not always be apparent in equal measure throughout the potential range of each candidate biofuel species. In some environments, a species could potentially produce valuable biological materials without posing a significant invasion threat. In this study, we develop a bioclimatic niche model for a candidate biofuel crop, Millettia pinnata, and apply the model to different climatic and irrigation scenarios to estimate the current and future patterns of climate suitability for its growth and naturalization. We use Australia as a case study for interpreting the niche model in terms that may be informative for both biofuels proponents and biosecurity regulators to plan management programmes that reflect the invasive potential in different areas. The model suggests that suitable growing conditions for M. pinnata in Australia are naturally restricted to the moist and semimoist tropics. Irriga- tion can extend the suitable growing conditions more widely throughout the tropics, and into more arid regions. Under future climate scenarios, suitable growing conditions for M. pinnata under natural rainfall contract towards the east coast, and extend southward into the subtropics. With irrigation, M. pinnata appears to have the potential in the future to naturalize across much of Australia. The bioclimatic modelling method demon- strated here is comparatively quick and easy, and can produce a rich array of data products to inform the inter- ests of both bioenergy proponents and biosecurity regulators. We show how this modelling can support the development of spatially explicit biosecurity policies designed to manage invasion risks in a manner that balances bioenergy and biosecurity concerns.","uuid":"28907a1e-83c8-3b75-b60d-54b8a98029a7","authors":[{"forename":"D.

Here we examine the global introduction history and invasion ecology of Proteaceae\u2014a large plant family with many taxa that have been widely disseminated by humans, but with few known invaders. To do this we compiled a global list of species and used boosted regression tree models to assess which factors are important in determining the status of a species (not introduced, introduced, naturalized or invasive). At least 402 of 1674 known species (24%) have been moved by humans out of their native ranges, 58 species (14%) have become naturalized but not invasive, and 8 species (2%) are invasive. The probability of naturalization was greatest for species with large native ranges, low susceptibility to Phytophthora root-rot fungus, large mammal-dispersed seeds, and with the capacity to resprout. The probability of naturalized species becoming invasive was greatest for species with large native ranges, those used as barrier plants, tall species, species with small seeds, and serotinous species. The traits driving invasiveness of Proteaceae were similar to those for acacias and pines. However, while some traits showed a consistent influence at introduction, naturalization and invasion, others appear to be influential at one stage only, and some have contrasting effects at different stages. Trait-based analyses therefore need to consider different invasion stages separately. On their own, these observations provide little predictive power for risk assessment, but when the causative mechanisms are understood (e.g. Phytophthora susceptibility) they provide valuable insights. As such there is considerable value in seeking the correlates and mechanisms underlying invasions for particular taxonomic or functional groups.

Areas of long-term climate stability are particularly interesting as they might have facilitated the survival of species over historical times and thus are crucial for understanding contemporary diversity patterns. In this study, we assessed the potential distribution of 23 estrildid finch species in order to analyse stability in recent and past diversity patterns and diversity centres in the Austral-Asiatic region. We used Maxent to predict recent distributions of each species and to project them onto the climatic conditions of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 21 000 yr BP) using two different scenarios (CCSM, MIROC). Te resulting diversity patterns were tested on presence and possible shifts of distribution centres. Diversity patterns of forest- and savannah-living species were considered combined and separately. During the LGM, potential diversity patterns of forest-living species corroborated well with postulated rainforest refuges situated on the eastern coast of Cape York Peninsula. Our results indicate a remarkably high stability of existing diversity centres. Although projections into the past show some differences in detail in the extent and exact position of the diversity centres, they reveal largely congruent large scale patterns in both time slices. However, the models suggest a northward shift towards exposed continental shelf areas that where dry during the LGM.

To account for latitudinal differences in the size and skeletal composition between species, SMR was mass normalized to that of a standard-sized (223 mg) ash-free dry mass individual. SMR was measured for 17 species of calcified invertebrates (bivalves, gastropods, urchins and brachiopods), using a single consistent methodology, including 11 species whose SMR was described for the first time. SMR of 15 out of 17 species had a mass-scaling exponent between 2\/3 and 1, with no greater support for a 3\/4 rather than a 2\/3 scaling exponent. After accounting for taxonomy and variability in parameter estimates among species using variance-weighted linear mixed effects modelling, temperature sensitivity of SMR had an activation energy (Ea) of 0.16 for both Northern and Southern Hemisphere species which was lower than predicted under the metabolic theory of ecology (Ea 0.2-1.2 eV). Northern Hemisphere species, however, had a higher SMR at each habitat temperature, but a lower mass-scaling exponent relative to SMR. Evolutionary trade-offs that may be driving differences in metabolic rate (such as metabolic cold adaptation of Northern Hemisphere species) will have important impacts on species abilities to respond to changing environments.","uuid":"194e4898-d387-38cc-ae67-3f371e02a79a","authors":[{"forename":"Sue-Ann","surname":"Watson"},{"forename":"Simon A.","surname":"Morley"},{"forename":"Amanda E.","surname":"Bates"},{"forename":"Melody S.","surname":"Clark"},{"forename":"Robert W.","surname":"Day"},{"forename":"Miles","surname":"Lamare"},{"forename":"Stephanie M.","surname":"Martin"},{"forename":"Paul C.","surname":"Southgate"},{"forename":"Koh Siang","surname":"Tan"},{"forename":"Paul A.","surname":"Tyler"},{"forename":"Lloyd S.","surname":"Peck"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Watson"},{"id":"6016482034","title":"Potential Distribution and Risk Assessment of an Invasive Plant Species: A Case Study of Hymenachne amplexicaulis in Australia","type":"Journal Article","volume":"19","issue":"1","url":"http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/10807039.2012.632293","tags":["2013","Aichi_B","AU","Australia","Australia_biodiversity","GBIF_used","GBits_32","global_biodiversity","invasive","plants","Target_9"],"notes":"GBIF data was  not used for Australia.","keywords":[],"pages":"53-79","year":"2013","abstract":"Given the limited resources available for weed management, a strategic approach is required to give the \u201cbest bang for your buck.\u201d The current study incorporates: (1) a model ensemble approach to identify areas of uncertainty and commonal- ity regarding a species invasive potential, (2) current distribution of the invaded species, and (3) connectivity of systems to identify target regions and focus efforts for more effective management.

There are severalmethods available to estimate species distribution and the effect of using them is not clearly understood. In this research, we assess the effect of species distributions derived from four geographical distribu- tion estimation methods on derived species richness and phylogenetic diversity (PD). We used the following four most common approaches to determine species geograph- ical distributions: (1) range-wide occurrences are records of presence from databases and museum collections; (2) marginal occurrences are generally expert drawn distri- butional maps; (3) species distribution modeling (SDM) combines geographic records and environmental data to predict species occurrence; and (4) a combined approach that constrains the statistical modeling predictions by themarginal occurrence distributions. Using these approaches, we estimated richness and PD and their correspondent geo- graphic hotspots for three different analysis resolutions using non-overlapping square windows of 2\u25e6,4\u25e6,and 6\u25e6 across Australia. We also assessed the differences of the resultant geographical distributions for three different spatial resolutions. We found markedly different hotspots when using range-wide occurrences and statistical model- ing approaches. Range-wide occurrences resulted in low values of species richness and PD and statistical modeling resulted in high values. The combined and marginal occur- rences approaches both had intermediate values, with the combined approach showing a finer level of detail than the marginal occurrences. There is a tendency for species range sizes between methods to converge with decreasing spatial resolution. Even for a relatively well-sampled group such as the Australian marsupials, the range-wide occur- rences approach is likely to underestimate the presence of species. Conversely, because SDMs usually do not account for dispersal abilities or biotic interactions, it is likely that species geographical distributions using this approach are overestimated. Depending on the method used, the resultant estimates of diversity may be completely different. Caution is needed when choosing the method to estimate species distribution.","uuid":"c6389153-5615-318b-9ab7-6ae418768c63","authors":[{"forename":"Mayra P.M.","surname":"Amboni"},{"forename":"Shawn W.","surname":"Laffan"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"International Journal of Geographical Information Science","firstAuthor":"Amboni"},{"id":"6016483764","title":"Three new species allied to the \u2018Mirbelia viminalis group\u2019 (Fabaceae: Mirbelieae), from Western Australia","type":"Journal Article","volume":"22","issue":"2","url":"http:\/\/florabase.dec.wa.gov.au\/science\/nuytsia\/636.pdf","tags":["2012","Aichi_E","AU","Australia","Australia_biodiversity","GBIF_used","herbarium","Target_19","taxonomy"],"keywords":[],"pages":"75-92","year":"2012","abstract":"Three new species allied to the \u2018Mirbelia viminalis group\u2019 (Fabaceae: Mirbelieae), from Western Australia.

Weed control authorities in the new areas at risk of invasion under climate change need to be alerted to this emerging threat, so that effective response measures can be taken.","uuid":"719113d2-801d-3d0a-89f1-fd896ef0a585","authors":[{"forename":"S.","surname":"Taylor"},{"forename":"L.","surname":"Kumar"},{"forename":"Nick","surname":"Reid"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Weed Research","firstAuthor":"Taylor"}]
