It was hypothesized that the fairy circles are the consequence of self-organizing spatial vegetation patterning arising from resource competition and facilitation. We examined the edaphic properties of fairy circles and variation in fairy circle size, density and landscape occupancy (% land surface) with edaphic properties and water availability at a local scale (<50 km) and with climate and vegetation characteristics at a regional scale. Soil moisture in the barren fairy circles declines from the center towards the periphery and is inversely correlated with soil organic carbon, possibly indicating that the peripheral grass roots access soil moisture that persists into the dry season within fairy circles. Fairy circle landscape occupancy is negatively correlated with precipitation and soil [N], consistent with fairy circles being the product of resource-competition. Regional fairy circle presence\/absence is highly predictable using an empirical model that includes narrow ranges of vegetation biomass, precipitation and temperature seasonality as predictor variables, indicating that fairy circles are likely a climate-dependent emergent phenomenon. This dependence of fairy circle occurrence on climate explains why fairy circles in some locations may appear and disappear over time. Fairy circles are only over-dispersed at high landscape occupancies, indicating that inter-circle competition may determine their spacing. We conclude that fairy circles are likely to be an emergent arid-grassland phenomenon that forms as a consequence of peripheral grass resource-competition and that the consequent barren circle may provide a resource-reservoir essential for the survival of the larger peripheral grasses and provides a habitat for fossicking fauna.","uuid":"0b02d57e-bde4-3eee-a985-318b2c77ef77","authors":[{"forename":"Michael D.","surname":"Cramer"},{"forename":"Nichole N.","surname":"Barger"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"PloS ONE","firstAuthor":"Cramer"},{"id":"6016484284","title":"Congruence and Diversity of Butterfly-Host Plant Associations at Higher Taxonomic Levels","type":"Journal Article","volume":"8","issue":"5","url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0063570","tags":["2013","Aichi_E","GBIF_used","GBIF_VIP","GBits_9","Global_biodiversity","South Africa","Target_19","VE","Venezuela","ZA"],"keywords":[],"pages":"e63570","year":"2013","abstract":"We aggregated data on butterfly-host plant associations from existing sources in order to address the following questions: (1) is there a general correlation between host diversity and butterfly species richness?, (2) has the evolution of host plant use followed consistent patterns across butterfly lineages?, (3) what is the common ancestral host plant for all butterfly lineages? The compilation included 44,148 records from 5,152 butterfly species (28.6% of worldwide species of Papilionoidea) and 1,193 genera (66.3%). The overwhelming majority of butterflies use angiosperms as host plants. Fabales is used by most species (1,007 spp.) from all seven butterfly families and most subfamilies, Poales is the second most frequently used order, but is mostly restricted to two species-rich subfamilies: Hesperiinae (56.5% of all Hesperiidae), and Satyrinae (42.6% of all Nymphalidae). We found a significant and strong correlation between host plant diversity and butterfly species richness. A global test for congruence (Parafit test) was sensitive to uncertainty in the butterfly cladogram, and suggests a mixed system with congruent associations between Papilionidae and magnoliids, Hesperiidae and monocots, and the remaining subfamilies with the eudicots (fabids and malvids), but also numerous random associations. The congruent associations are also recovered as the most probable ancestral states in each node using maximum likelihood methods. The shift from basal groups to eudicots appears to be more likely than the other way around, with the only exception being a Satyrine-clade within the Nymphalidae that feed on monocots. Our analysis contributes to the visualization of the complex pattern of interactions at superfamily level and provides a context to discuss the timing of changes in host plant utilization that might have promoted diversification in some butterfly lineages.","uuid":"7e09fe52-b6a1-34e3-b312-ce23821caecc","authors":[{"forename":"Jos\u00e9 R.","surname":"Ferrer-Paris"},{"forename":"Ada","surname":"S\u00e1nchez-Mercado"},{"forename":"\u00c1ngel L.","surname":"Viloria"},{"forename":"John","surname":"Donaldson"}],"editors":[{"forename":"Hans Henrik","surname":"Bruun"}],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Ferrer-Paris"},{"id":"6016483034","title":"Montpellier broom (Genista monspessulana) and Spanish broom (Spartium junceum) in South Africa: An assessment of invasiveness and options for management","type":"Journal Article","volume":"87","url":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S025462991300241X","tags":["2013","Aichi_B","GBIF_primary","GBIF_used","GBits_8","invasive","plants","pseudo_absences","SDM","South Africa","South Africa_biodiversity","Target_9","ZA"],"keywords":["Fabaceae","Legislation","Legumes","Management","Soil seed banks","Spatial scales"],"pages":"134-145","year":"2013","publisher":"South African Association of Botanists","abstract":"The legumes (Fabaceae) Genistamonspessulana and Spartium junceumaremajor invaders in several other parts of theworld, but not yet so in South Africa.Wedetermine their current distributions in South Africa at different spatial scales, assess population structure (soil seed banks and size at reproduction) evaluate current manage- ment activities, and provide recommendations for control (including assessing the feasibility of nation-wide eradication).

However, few studies have determined the mechanisms underlying lag phases. Such a mechanistic understanding is vital if the potential ecosystem-level impacts are to be predicted and the invasion risks to be managed proactively. Here we examine Banksia ericifolia, introduced for floriculture to South Africa, as a case study. We found 18 sites where the species has been planted, with self-sustaining (naturalized) populations at four sites, and an invasive population at one site. The invasion originated from around 100 individuals planted 35 years ago; after several fires this population has grown to approximately 10 000 plants covering about 127 ha. The current invasion of B. ericifolia already has ecosystem-level impacts, for example the nectar available to bird pollinators has more than doubled, potentially disrupting native pollination networks. If fires occurred at the other naturalized sites we anticipate populations would rapidly spread and densify with invaded areas ultimately become banksia-dominated woodlands. Indeed the only site other than the invasive site where fire has occurred regularly is already showing signs of rapid population growth and spread. However, recruitment is mainly immediately post fire and no seed bank accumulates in the soil, mechanical control of adult plants is cheap and effective, and immature plants are easily detected. This study is a first in illustrating the importance of fire in driving lag phases and provides a valuable example for why it is essential to determine the mechanisms that mediate lag phases in introduced plant species. Serotinous species that have been introduced to areas where fire is suppressed could easily be misinterpreted as low risk species whilst they remain in a lag phase, but they can represent a major invasion risk.","uuid":"d97b69a9-dea2-3383-9ae9-8fe696403f24","authors":[{"forename":"Sjirk","surname":"Geerts"},{"forename":"Desika","surname":"Moodley"},{"forename":"Mirijam","surname":"Gaertner"},{"forename":"Johannes J.","surname":"Le Roux"},{"forename":"Melodie A.","surname":"McGeoch"},{"forename":"Cedric","surname":"Muofhe"},{"forename":"David M.","surname":"Richardson"},{"forename":"John R.

A third species, C. corindum, may also have significant invasion potential. However, in some regions the native status of these species is not clear, hampering management. For example, in South Africa it is unknown whether C. halicacabum and C. corindum are native, and this is a major constraint to on-going biological control programmes against invasive C. grandiflorum. We review the geography, biology and ecology of selected members of the genus with an emphasis on the two most widespread invaders, C. halicacabum and C. grandiflorum. Specifically, we use molecular data to reconstruct a phylogeny of the group in order to shed light on the native ranges of C. halicacabum and C. corindum in southern Africa. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that southern African accessions of these species are closely related to South American taxa indicating human-mediated introduction and\/or natural long distance dispersal. Then, on a global scale we use species distribution modelling to predict potential suitable climate regions where these species are currently absent. Native range data were used to test the accuracy with which bioclimatic modelling can identify the known invasive ranges of these species. Results show that Cardiospermum species have potential to spread further in already invaded or introduced regions in Australia, Africa and Asia, underlining the importance of resolving taxonomic uncertainties for future management efforts. Bioclimatic modelling predicts Australia to have highly favourable environmental conditions for C. corindum and therefore vigilance against this species should be high. Species distribution modelling showed that native range data over fit predicted suitable ranges, and that factors other than climate influence establishment potential. This review opens the door to better understand the global biogeography of the genus Cardiospermum, with direct implications for management, while also highlighting gaps in current research.","uuid":"2b7f3779-6034-3d6f-a9a4-ff46515c3af8","authors":[{"forename":"Enelge","surname":"Gildenhuys"},{"forename":"Allan G.","surname":"Ellis"},{"forename":"Scott P.","surname":"Carroll"},{"forename":"Johannes J.","surname":"Le Roux"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"NeoBiota","firstAuthor":"Gildenhuys"},{"id":"6140661094","title":"Different Traits Determine Introduction, Naturalization and Invasion Success In Woody Plants: Proteaceae as a Test Case","type":"Journal Article","volume":"8","issue":"9","url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0075078","tags":["2013","Aichi_B","Australia_biodiversity","GBIF_used","invasive","South Africa","Target_9","ZA"],"keywords":[],"pages":"e75078","year":"2013","abstract":"A major aim of invasion ecology is to identify characteristics of successful invaders.

To do this we compiled a global list of species and used boosted regression tree models to assess which factors are important in determining the status of a species (not introduced, introduced, naturalized or invasive). At least 402 of 1674 known species (24%) have been moved by humans out of their native ranges, 58 species (14%) have become naturalized but not invasive, and 8 species (2%) are invasive. The probability of naturalization was greatest for species with large native ranges, low susceptibility to Phytophthora root-rot fungus, large mammal-dispersed seeds, and with the capacity to resprout. The probability of naturalized species becoming invasive was greatest for species with large native ranges, those used as barrier plants, tall species, species with small seeds, and serotinous species. The traits driving invasiveness of Proteaceae were similar to those for acacias and pines. However, while some traits showed a consistent influence at introduction, naturalization and invasion, others appear to be influential at one stage only, and some have contrasting effects at different stages. Trait-based analyses therefore need to consider different invasion stages separately. On their own, these observations provide little predictive power for risk assessment, but when the causative mechanisms are understood (e.g. Phytophthora susceptibility) they provide valuable insights. As such there is considerable value in seeking the correlates and mechanisms underlying invasions for particular taxonomic or functional groups.

The first method compares visual color classifications of primary variables, the second uses binary combinations of these variables to produce a categorical classification of management actions, the third is a target-based optimization using Marxan, and the fourth is conservation ranking with Zonation. We present results from each method, and compare the latter three approaches for spatial coverage, biodiversity representation, fishing cost and persistence probability. All results included large areas in the north, central, and southern parts of western Madagascar. Achieving 30% representation targets with Marxan required twice the fish catch loss than the categorical method. The categorical classification and Zonation do not consider targets for conservation features.

The management category portfolio has complete coverage, and presents several management recommendations including strict protection. Zonation produces rapid conservation rankings across large, diverse datasets. Marxan is useful for identifying strict protected areas that meet representation targets, and minimize exposure probabilities for conservation features at low economic cost. We show that methods based on Zonation and a simple combination of variables can produce results comparable to Marxan for species representation and catch losses, demonstrating the value of comparing alternative approaches during initial stages of the planning process. Choosing an appropriate approach ultimately depends on scientific and political factors including representation targets, likelihood of adoption, and persistence goals.","uuid":"c3ff65a8-bcd9-3362-b33d-38ec11f0de87","authors":[{"forename":"Thomas F.","surname":"Allnutt"},{"forename":"Timothy R.","surname":"McClanahan"},{"forename":"Serge","surname":"Andr\u00e9fou\u00ebt"},{"forename":"Merrill","surname":"Baker"},{"forename":"Erwann","surname":"Lagabrielle"},{"forename":"Caleb","surname":"McClennen"},{"forename":"Andry J.

Larger skewness values are related to inventories with wider scope. SA Proteas display the most skewed distribution. Skewness in California may be explained not only by the nature and scope of the inventory but also by the scale used for mapping.

The mitochondrial COI gene and four nuclear introns (Eef1a1, MGF, SPTBN1, Bfib7) were used for the construction of gene trees.

These monophyletic lineages differ by at least 7.9% (\u00b10.3) and these results are partly confirmed by a multilocus network of the combined nuclear intron dataset. Ecological niche modeling in MaxEnt supports a strong correlation between regional biomes and the distribution of distinct evolutionary lineages of Rhabdomys. A Bayesian relaxed molecular clock suggests that the geographic clades diverged between 3.09 and 4.30Ma, supporting the hypothesis that the radiation within the genus coincides with paleoclimatic changes (and the establishment of the biomes) characterizing the Miocene-Pliocene boundary. Marked genetic divergence at the mitochondrial DNA level, coupled with strong nuclear and mtDNA signals of non-monophyly of R. pumilio, support the notion that a taxonomic revision of the genus is needed.","uuid":"a4742032-be54-3474-b7b2-620711a20e81","authors":[{"forename":"Nina du","surname":"Toit"},{"forename":"Bettine Jansen","surname":"Van Vuuren"},{"forename":"Sonja","surname":"Matthee"},{"forename":"Conrad A.","surname":"Matthee"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Toit"},{"id":"6016484444","title":"The African wintering distribution and ecology of the Corncrake Crex crex","type":"Journal Article","url":"http:\/\/www.journals.cambridge.org\/abstract_S0959270912000159","tags":["2012","Africa","Africa_biodiversity","Aichi_E","birds","China","CN","conservation","FR","France","GB","GBIF_used","in_press","South Africa","Target_19","ZA"],"keywords":[],"pages":"1-14","year":"2012","abstract":"The Corncrake Crex crex breeds in the Palearctic but overwinters in central and southern Africa. While some information had previously been gathered about the Corncrake\u2019s African wintering distribution, we here analyse a much more comprehensive database of 1,284 records based on a five-year desk study completed in January 2011 and use those records selected for spatiotemporal accuracy to build a continental distribution model. Our model was based mostly on climatic variables and predicts a high suitability for most eastern Africa countries south of the equator, but none of the western African countries with the exception of Angola and Namibia. Both the actual number of records as well as the distribution model thus indicates that the vast majority of Corncrakes migrate through and overwinter in the eastern parts of Africa. Because large parts of Angola, Mozambique, north-eastern Namibia, and Tanzania are predicted as suitable but have yielded very few actual records so far, they should be targeted for future field work. A very small number of Corncrakes may oversummer in Africa but such individuals are possibly unable to migrate due to sickness or injury, or may be first-year birds that are not ready to breed. An analysis of habitat and population density data indicates that, within the continental distribution, Corncrakes are mostly concentrated within grass-dominated habitats, mirroring their habitat preferences in the breeding areas. Corncrakes reach their wintering distribution mostly through an eastern migration route, but some individuals or subpopulations from the Western breeding population also use a western migration route. We also document the food choices, weights, and causes of injury and death within Africa. Because habitat conversion is accelerating all across Africa, we recommend constant monitoring of habitat availability and population densities within the Corncrake\u2019s wintering distribution.","uuid":"0419a91b-8795-3f72-8257-5767a66d491c","authors":[{"forename":"Bruno A.","surname":"Walther"},{"forename":"P.","surname":"Barry Taylor"},{"forename":"Norbert","surname":"Sch\u00e4ffer"},{"forename":"Sue","surname":"Robinson"},{"forename":"Frederic Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric","surname":"Jiguet"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Bird Conservation International","firstAuthor":"Walther"},{"id":"6016484644","title":"A qualitative ecological risk assessment of the invasive Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus in a sub-tropical African river system (Limpopo River, South Africa)","type":"Journal Article","volume":"online","url":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1002\/aqc.2258","tags":["2012","Aichi_B","fish","freshwater","GBIF_used","invasive","in_press","South Africa","South Africa_biodiversity","Target_9","university","ZA"],"keywords":["indigenous Oreochromis","invasion","Nile tilapia","risk assessment","Southern Africa"],"pages":"n\/a-n\/a","year":"2012","abstract":"This study outlines the development of a qualitative risk assessment method and its application as a screening tool for determining the risk of establishment and spread of the invasive Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus (Linnaeus, 1758), within the central sub-catchment of the Limpopo River basin in northern South Africa. The assessment used known physiological tolerance limits of O. niloticus in relation to minimum water temperature, presence or absence of dams, seasonality of river flows, and the presence of indigenous fish species of concern to identify river systems that would be suitable for O. niloticus establishment. River sections along the Limpopo main river channel and the immediate reaches of its associated tributaries east of the Limpopo\/Lephalala river confluence along the Botswana\u2013South Africa\u2013Zimbabwe border were identified as being highly vulnerable to O. niloticus invasion. Rivers in the upper Bushveld catchment (Upper Limpopo, Mogalakwena, Lephalala, Mokolo, Matlabas and Crocodile rivers) were categorized as of medium ecological risk, while headwater streams were considered to be of low ecological risk. The decrease in vulnerability between lowveld and highveld river sections was mainly a function of low water temperatures (8\u201312\u00b0C) associated with increasing altitude. Oreochromis niloticus is already established in the lower catchment of the Limpopo River basin where indigenous congenerics are at an extinction risk through hybridization and competition exclusion. Oreochromis niloticus, therefore, poses an ecologically unacceptable risk to river systems in the upper catchment where it is yet to establish. The current risk assessment model provides a useful preliminary framework for the identification of river systems that are vulnerable to an O. niloticus invasion where conservation measures should be directed and implemented to prevent its introduction and spread within the Limpopo river system.

Faunal abundance, species richness, species diversity, and proportion of rare species were relatively uniform along the Channel, as were faunal abundance, species diversity and proportion of rare species down the shore. Overall species richness per station, however, was significantly lower at LWN than at either MLW or LWS, although the distribution of species richness over the shore did not depart from random at one of the three sites. Overall faunal abundance and those of individual component species were dispersed patchily through the bed. The nature of the faunal assemblages present, however, varied significantly throughout the bed, both along the Channel at each shore-height horizon, and down the shore at each site. LWN assemblages formed a unit distinct from those at MLW and LWS. Overall, the shore-height axis accounted for 47% and the along-shore axis 28% of total assemblage variation. Faunal assemblages were randomly structured at each nodal intersection point of the down-shore and along-shore axes, but were significantly non-randomly assembled down the shore at each site and along the Channel at each shore-height horizon except at the LWN level. Components of total assemblage variance were largest at the smallest scale investigated (1 m). Higher seagrass horizons are not just progressively more impoverished versions of lower ones and although macrofaunal assemblage composition is heavily influenced by shore height much of the ecological structure of faunal assemblages seems little affected by tidal horizon.

Results The macroecological patterns of the three distributional metrics displayed lognormal-like frequency distributions. Most invasive species had significantly lower percolation exponents and larger native ranges than expected from random draws from the entire assemblage of Australian acacias, but percolation intercepts were not significantly different. This can be explained by a selection bias at the early stages of invasion. Main conclusions The outcome of the natural experiment of transplanting many Australian acacias into novel environments is not random. While invasive species have a particular macroecological pattern, this can be explained by the observation that species with large native ranges and low percolation exponents (i.e. high population increase rate) are most likely to have been introduced and naturalized. Whether this pattern is an artefact of human selection or reflects a human bias towards selecting invasive species remains to be seen.","uuid":"17411e1a-15b8-3049-95b2-780e731091dc","authors":[{"forename":"Cang","surname":"Hui"},{"forename":"David M.","surname":"Richardson"},{"forename":"Mark P.","surname":"Robertson"},{"forename":"John R.

It invades grasslands, savannas and wetlands where it has a significant impact on biological diversity. Control of C. macrocephalum has, so far, been based on herbicides, as mechanical approaches were found to exacerbate infestations through disturbance. However, due to the extent of the invasion, the financial and environmental costs of treating all C. macrocephalum infestations with herbicides would be prohibitive.

This has created the opportunity to explore how evolutionary, ecological, historical and sociological factors interact to affect the distribution, usage, invasiveness and perceptions of a globally important group of plants. This editorial provides the background for the 20 papers in this special issue of Diversity and Distributions that focusses on the global cross-disciplinary experiment of introduced Australian acacias. Location Australia and global. Methods The papers of the special issue are discussed in the context of a unified framework for biological invasions. Distributions of species were mapped across Australia, their representation in bioclimatic zones examined and the potential global distribution of the group modelled. By collating a variety of different lists, we determined which Australian acacias have reached different stages in the introduction-naturalization-invasion continuum in different parts of the world. Paradigms and key research questions relating to barriers to invasion, stages of invasion and management perceptions are sketched. Results According to our global database of Australian acacia records, 386 species have been moved outside Australia by human agency, 71 species are naturalized or weedy, and 23 are unequivocally invasive. Climatic models suggest that about a third of the world\u2019s land surface is climatically suitable for Australian acacias. Many species are commercially important crops or are useful for other purposes and have been extensively planted, and many different human perceptions of Australian acacias exist in different parts of the world. The papers in the special issue cover all the barriers, stages and processes that define biological invasions and touch on many aspects: history and the human dimension; aspects of the species pool; species traits; biotic interactions; climate and niche; and management. Main conclusions Australian acacias are an excellent model group for examining interactions between evolutionary, ecological and socio-economic drivers of species introductions. New insights have emerged on the biological, ecological and evolutionary correlates of naturalization and invasion, but human usage factors permeate all explanatory models. Understanding and managing introduced Australian acacias requires a fundamental and integrative appreciation of both intrinsic (e.g. species traits) and extrinsic (e.g. human usage and perceptions) aspects. \u00aa 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd DOI: 10.1111\/j","uuid":"b61476d7-f069-3d29-9b61-a512d1fc4538","authors":[{"forename":"David M.","surname":"Richardson"},{"forename":"Jane","surname":"Carruthers"},{"forename":"Cang","surname":"Hui"},{"forename":"Fiona A.

Research using this database has led to an improved understanding of the migrants\u2019 distributions, especially of threatened species such as the Corncrake Crex crex, the Aquatic Warbler Acrocephalus paludicola, the Basra Reed Warbler Acrocephalus griseldis, the Cinereous Bunting Emberiza cineracea and the Ortolan Bunting Emberiza hortulana, as well as the identification of habitat use, macroecology and conservation priority areas. In this study, we used the available point-locality records to map the sub-Saharan distribution of 65 species of passerine migrants using a combination of presence-only and presence-absence distribution modelling techniques (Walther et al. 2010). Combining these distributions with data on the conservation status and population declines of 64 of these 65 species published by BirdLife International, we found that species which declined during the period 1970\u2013 2000 were concentrated in the Sahelian region, while species with more stable populations were overwintering all across Africa. This clear geographical signal then led to a comprehensive literature review of recent climatological, biological and ecological changes in the Sahelian and more southerly Sudanian zone. The main conclusions are: (1) the 1968\u20131997 drought was exceptionally severe; (2) year-to-year climatic variability was very high in the Sahel, and higher than in the rest of sub-Saharan Africa; (3) these climate extremes had unusually strong repercussions on soil erosion, above- and below-ground water levels, and natural vegetation, especially perennial woody vegetation, with some negative effects still apparent to this day despite the recent re-greening of the Sahel; (4) driven by one of the highest human population growth rates in the world, agricultural expansion and loss of natural non-forest vegetation was higher in the Sahelian and Sudanian zones than in any other sub-Saharan region; (5) the effects of cattle grazing and wood exploitation may also have been more severe in this region than in other sub-Saharan regions. The implications for migrant birds are that, even before the drought beginning in the late 1960s, there was a long-term trend of humans appropriating more and more natural resources, recently accelerated through exponential population growth and more intensive agricultural methods. Therefore, fewer and fewer natural resources are being left for animal populations, including migrant birds. The recent re-greening of the Sahel and the parallel improvements in agricultural techniques during the last decade have improved the welfare of human populations, but have had no or very little positiveeffect on natural resources utilized by wild animal populations. This widespread ecological transformation, which was apparently more severe in the Sahelian region than in any other sub- Saharan region, may therefore be one of the main long-term drivers of the population declines of those migrants which mainly overwinter in these regions, and possibly even for bird species which use these regions only for refuelling. Discussing the results from this and other recent studies, we finish by making a few recommendations for future research and conservation work.","uuid":"255c0d5d-02a3-3bc1-b597-2717a648e6d0","authors":[{"forename":"Bruno A.","surname":"Walther"},{"forename":"Adriaan Van","surname":"Niekerk"},{"forename":"Carsten","surname":"Rahbek"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Walther"},{"id":"6016480054","title":"Modelling horses for novel climate courses: insights from projecting potential distributions of native and alien Australian acacias with correlative and mechanistic models","type":"Journal Article","volume":"17","issue":"5","url":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/j.1472-4642.2011.00811.x","tags":["2011","Aichi_B","AU","Australia","climate","CSIRO","GBIF_used","invasive","niche_modeling","SDM","South Africa","Target_9","university","ZA"],"keywords":["Bioclimatic model","biological invasions","correlative model","fundamental niche","invasion dynamics","K\u00f6ppen\u2013Geiger climate zone","mechanistic niche model","modelling methods","realized niche","species distribution model"],"pages":"978-1000","year":"2011","abstract":"Aim Investigate the relative abilities of different bioclimatic models and data sets to project species ranges in novel environments utilizing the natural experiment in biogeography provided by Australian Acacia species. Location Australia, South Africa. Methods We built bioclimatic models for Acacia cyclops and Acacia pycnantha using two discriminatory correlative models (MaxEnt and Boosted Regression Trees) and a mechanistic niche model (CLIMEX). We fitted models using two training data sets: native-range data only (\u2018restricted\u2019) and all available global data excluding South Africa (\u2018full\u2019). We compared the ability of these techniques to project suitable climate for independent records of the species in South Africa. In addition, we assessed the global potential distributions of the species to projected climate change. Results All model projections assessed against their training data, the South African data and globally were statistically significant. In South Africa and globally, the additional information contained in the full data set generally improved model sensitivity, but at the expense of increased modelled prevalence, particularly in extrapolation areas for the correlative models. All models projected some climatically suitable areas in South Africa not currently occupied by the species. At the global scale, widespread and biologically unrealistic projections by the correlative models were explained by open-ended response curves, a problem which was not always addressed by broader background climate space or by the extra information in the full data set. In contrast, the global projections for CLIMEX were more conservative. Projections into 2070 indicated a polewards shift in climate suitability and a decrease in model interpolation area. Main conclusions Our results highlight the importance of carefully interpreting model projections in novel climates, particularly for correlative models. Much work is required to ensure bioclimatic models performed in a robust and ecologically plausible manner in novel climates. We explore reasons for variations between models and suggest methods and techniques for future improvements.","uuid":"3c78d721-dcad-3051-bead-e605d8e0b1fd","authors":[{"forename":"Bruce L.","surname":"Webber"},{"forename":"Colin J.","surname":"Yates"},{"forename":"David C.","surname":"Le Maitre"},{"forename":"John K.","surname":"Scott"},{"forename":"Darren J.","surname":"Kriticos"},{"forename":"Noboru","surname":"Ota"},{"forename":"Asha","surname":"McNeill"},{"forename":"Johannes J.","surname":"Le Roux"},{"forename":"Guy F.","surname":"Midgley"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Webber"},{"id":"6016476584","title":"Ethnobotany, phytochemistry and pharmacology of Podocarpus sensu latissimo (s.l.)","type":"Journal Article","volume":"76","issue":"1","url":"http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/B7XN9-4XBP9FH-1\/2\/1d620bb6185f6134c01606d9fcf7beb5","tags":["2010","GBIF_used","plants","South Africa","taxonomy","ZA"],"keywords":["Chemotaxonomy","Ethnobotany","Pharmacology","Podocarpus","Traditional uses"],"pages":"1-24","year":"2010","uuid":"91c745ec-26cd-3fe6-85e7-6280ec879e62","authors":[{"forename":"H.

Recent studies have revealed the family to be more diverse, with a further five species from Madagascar, one from the Comores archipelago and seven from sub-Saharan Africa, which are currently in the process of being formally described. This brings the total number of known species globally to 34. Phylogenetic analysis of morphological features of the larvae reveals that the type species, Prosopistoma variegatum Latreille, 1883, a Madagascan species, along with two other Madagascan species, belongs to a clade which is different to the majority of other Afrotropical species. It is more closely related to the European species, the species from the Middle East and several of the species from the Oriental and Australasian regions. One possible explanation is diversification of this \u2018P. variegatum\u2019 clade after Madagascar and India separated from Africa. The precursors of this clade may have been carried northwards on the Indian Plate, and subsequently dispersed to Europe, and to Australia via the Indo-Pacific islands. A concurrent dispersal of the now predominantly mainland African clade may have occurred and, in Madagascar and the Oriental realm, members of this group occur sympatrically with, or in close geographic proximity to, members of the \u2018P. variegatum\u2019 clade.","uuid":"7318fb44-03a2-38da-8f64-a23336895ccb","authors":[{"forename":"Helen M.","surname":"Barber-James"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Aquatic Insects","firstAuthor":"Barber-James"}]
