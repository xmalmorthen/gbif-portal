Societies often seek to mitigate threats to these services through large-scale, costly restoration projects, such as the over one billion dollar Great Lakes Restoration Initiative currently underway. To help inform these efforts, we merged high-resolution spatial analyses of environmental stressors with mapping of ecosystem services for all five Great Lakes. Cumulative ecosystem stress is highest in near-shore habitats, but also extends offshore in Lakes Erie, Ontario, and Michigan. Variation in cumulative stress is driven largely by spatial concordance among multiple stressors, indicating the importance of considering all stressors when planning restoration activities. In addition, highly stressed areas reflect numerous different combinations of stressors rather than a single suite of problems, suggesting that a detailed understanding of the stressors needing alleviation could improve restoration planning. We also find that many important areas for fisheries and recreation are subject to high stress, indicating that ecosystem degradation could be threatening key services. Current restoration efforts have targeted high-stress sites almost exclusively, but generally without knowledge of the full range of stressors affecting these locations or differences among sites in service provisioning. Our results demonstrate that joint spatial analysis of stressors and ecosystem services can provide a critical foundation for maximizing social and ecological benefits from restoration investments.","uuid":"f79c8173-85f8-3c2c-a4e0-be51f6e37a65","authors":[{"forename":"J.

Simple guidance for establishing spacing between individual protected sites can provide reliable rules of thumb to help ensure connectivity. Spacing rules for protected network design are relatively new to marine spatial planning, though so far they have been generically and indiscriminately applied to all types of habitats based on a single range of distance values. Here we address the extent to which such rules capture subtleties associated with dispersal distances varying among species in different regions and habitats. We applied a 50\u2013100 km global spacing rule (SRglob), also recently applied in the California Marine Life Protection Act (MLPA) process and based on available global larval dispersal data, to a previously assessed network in the Gulf of California. Using larval dispersal data for species within this region (SRreg), we associated each species with eight unique habitats (SRhab*) and we evaluated connectivity by means of different spacing rules (SRglob, SRreg and SRhab*) using graph-theory. The existing spacing rule employed by the MLPA process (SRglob) was found to be robust and conservative when applied to the Gulf of California or to its different habitats (i.e., the lower limit for dispersal distance includes the distance for all species in the Gulf). We found that species in different habitats exhibit statistically distinct dispersal profiles. Therefore, some habitats could be evaluated with more relaxed spacing rules (i.e., larger distances), than those proposed by the rules of thumb. Our work identifies a conservation planning trade-off when implementing spacing rules: already proposed rules are robust but at the cost of efficiency. Habitat-specific spacing rules should be considered for more efficient marine conservation planning solutions.","uuid":"cd912217-5cc0-3eb4-80aa-7e189d606ed1","authors":[{"forename":"Jos\u00e9 D.","surname":"Anad\u00f3n"},{"forename":"Maria","surname":"del Mar Mancha-Cisneros"},{"forename":"Benjamin D.","surname":"Best"},{"forename":"Leah R.","surname":"Gerber"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Ecosphere","firstAuthor":"Anad\u00f3n"},{"id":"6116765474","title":"A Revision of Blindia (Seligeriaceae) from Southern South America","type":"Journal Article","volume":"116","issue":"3","url":"http:\/\/www.bioone.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1639\/0007-2745-116.3.263","tags":["2013","Chile_biodiversity","GBIF_used","GBits_10","taxonomy","US"],"keywords":["Cape Horn","Chile","species distribution","taxonomy"],"pages":"263-280","year":"2013","abstract":"Blindia Bruch & Schimp. is represented in southern South America by eight species.

Evidence for such range dynamics and refugia in the unglaciated Gulf-Atlantic Coastal Plain stems largely from terrestrial species, and aquatic species Pleistocene responses remain relatively uninvestigated. Heterandria formosa, a wide-ranging regional endemic, presents an ideal system to test the expansion-contraction model within this biota. By integrating ecological niche modeling and phylogeography, we infer the Pleistocene history of this livebearing fish (Poeciliidae) and test for several predicted distributional and genetic effects of the last glaciation. RESULTS: Paleoclimatic models predicted range contraction to a single southwest Florida peninsula refugium during the Last Glacial Maximum, followed by northward expansion. We inferred spatial-population subdivision into four groups that reflect genetic barriers outside this refuge. Several other features of the genetic data were consistent with predictions derived from an expansion-contraction model: limited intraspecific divergence (e.g. mean mtDNA p-distance = 0.66%); a pattern of mtDNA diversity (mean Hd = 0.934; mean pi = 0.007) consistent with rapid, recent population expansion; a lack of mtDNA isolation-by-distance; and clinal variation in allozyme diversity with higher diversity at lower latitudes near the predicted refugium. Statistical tests of mismatch distributions and coalescent simulations of the gene tree lent greater support to a scenario of post-glacial expansion and diversification from a single refugium than to any other model examined (e.g. multiple-refugia scenarios). CONCLUSIONS: Congruent results from diverse data indicate H. formosa fits the classic Pleistocene expansion-contraction model, even as the genetic data suggest additional ecological influences on population structure. While evidence for Plio-Pleistocene Gulf Coast vicariance is well described for many freshwater species presently codistributed with H. formosa, this species demography and diversification departs notably from this pattern. Species-specific expansion-contraction dynamics may therefore have figured more prominently in shaping Coastal Plain evolutionary history than previously thought. Our findings bolster growing appreciation for the complexity of phylogeographical structuring within North America's southern refugia, including responses of Coastal Plain freshwater biota to Pleistocene climatic fluctuations.","uuid":"3d4d4b6a-7414-3125-b57f-df08eea61c39","authors":[{"forename":"Justin C.","surname":"Bagley"},{"forename":"Michael","surname":"Sandel"},{"forename":"Joseph","surname":"Travis"},{"forename":"Mar\u00eda De","surname":"Lozano-Vilano"},{"forename":"Jerald B.","surname":"Johnson"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Bagley"},{"id":"6016482624","title":"Mapping the biodiversity of tropical insects: species richness and inventory completeness of African sphingid moths","type":"Journal Article","volume":"22","issue":"5","url":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/geb.12039","tags":["2013","Africa_biodiversity","Aichi_E","CH","GB","GBIF_used","Switzerland","Target_19","US","Yale University"],"keywords":["co-kriging interpolation","hawkmoths","Lepidoptera","pattern","sampling effort","spatial","Sphingidae","Sub-Saharan Africa"],"pages":"586-595","year":"2013","uuid":"3a416913-3bdd-3a18-b155-8e8ecc21cc8c","authors":[{"forename":"Liliana","surname":"Ballesteros-Mejia"},{"forename":"Ian J.","surname":"Kitching"},{"forename":"Walter","surname":"Jetz"},{"forename":"Peter","surname":"Nagel"},{"forename":"Jan","surname":"Beck"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Ballesteros-Mejia"},{"id":"6075577294","title":"Biodiversity ensures plant-pollinator phenological synchrony against climate change","type":"Journal Article","url":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/ele.12170","tags":["2013","Aichi_E","bees","climate","GBIF_used","GBits_10","SE","Sweden","Target_19","US","US_biodiversity"],"keywords":["bees","crop pollination","ecosystem function","ecosystem services","phenology","pollination","response diversity","stabilising mechanism"],"year":"2013","abstract":"Climate change has the potential to alter the phenological synchrony between interacting mutualists, such as plants and their pollinators.

Here, we explore how biodiversity might enhance and stabilise phenological synchrony between a valuable crop, apple and its native pollinators. We combine 46 years of data on apple flowering phenology with historical records of bee pollinators over the same period.

In addition, invasive nonnative species may expand into new regions under future climate conditions and contribute to the decline of native species. We evaluated future distributions for the threatened European crayfish fauna in response to climate change, watershed boundaries, and the spread of invasive crayfishes, which transmit the crayfish plague, a lethal disease for native European crayfishes. We used climate projections from general circulation models and statistical models based on Mahalanobis distance to predict climate-suitable regions for native and invasive crayfishes in the middle and at the end of the 21st century. We identified these suitable regions as accessible or inaccessible on the basis of major watershed boundaries and present occurrences and evaluated potential future overlap with 3 invasive North American crayfishes. Climate-suitable areas decreased for native crayfishes by 19% to 72%, and the majority of future suitable areas for most of these species were inaccessible relative to native and current distributions. Overlap with invasive crayfish plague-transmitting species was predicted to increase. Some native crayfish species (e.g., noble crayfish [Astacus astacus]) had no future refugia that were unsuitable for the modeled nonnative species. Our results emphasize the importance of preventing additional introductions and spread of invasive crayfishes in Europe to minimize interactions between the multiple stressors of climate change and invasive species, while suggesting candidate regions for the debatable management option of assisted colonization.","uuid":"bb4f110b-8556-3948-961a-e4a8b8c4e3ee","authors":[{"forename":"C\u00e9sar","surname":"Capinha"},{"forename":"Eric R.","surname":"Larson"},{"forename":"Elena","surname":"Tricarico"},{"forename":"Julian D.","surname":"Olden"},{"forename":"Francesca","surname":"Gherardi"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Capinha"},{"id":"6066500554","title":"Are Namibian \"fairy circles\" the consequence of self-organizing spatial vegetation patterning?","type":"Journal Article","volume":"8","issue":"8","url":"http:\/\/www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov\/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3744476&tool=pmcentrez&rendertype=abstract","tags":["2013","Aichi_E","Angola_biodiversity","Botswana_biodiversity","GBIF_used","GBIF_VIP","GBits_10","Namibia_biodiversity","South Africa","South Africa_biodiversity","Target_19","US","ZA"],"keywords":[],"pages":"e70876","year":"2013","abstract":"Causes of over-dispersed barren \"fairy circles\" that are often surrounded by ca. 0.5 m tall peripheral grasses in a matrix of shorter (ca. 0.2 m tall) grasses in Namibian grasslands remain mysterious. It was hypothesized that the fairy circles are the consequence of self-organizing spatial vegetation patterning arising from resource competition and facilitation. We examined the edaphic properties of fairy circles and variation in fairy circle size, density and landscape occupancy (% land surface) with edaphic properties and water availability at a local scale (<50 km) and with climate and vegetation characteristics at a regional scale. Soil moisture in the barren fairy circles declines from the center towards the periphery and is inversely correlated with soil organic carbon, possibly indicating that the peripheral grass roots access soil moisture that persists into the dry season within fairy circles. Fairy circle landscape occupancy is negatively correlated with precipitation and soil [N], consistent with fairy circles being the product of resource-competition. Regional fairy circle presence\/absence is highly predictable using an empirical model that includes narrow ranges of vegetation biomass, precipitation and temperature seasonality as predictor variables, indicating that fairy circles are likely a climate-dependent emergent phenomenon. This dependence of fairy circle occurrence on climate explains why fairy circles in some locations may appear and disappear over time. Fairy circles are only over-dispersed at high landscape occupancies, indicating that inter-circle competition may determine their spacing. We conclude that fairy circles are likely to be an emergent arid-grassland phenomenon that forms as a consequence of peripheral grass resource-competition and that the consequent barren circle may provide a resource-reservoir essential for the survival of the larger peripheral grasses and provides a habitat for fossicking fauna.","uuid":"0b02d57e-bde4-3eee-a985-318b2c77ef77","authors":[{"forename":"Michael D.","surname":"Cramer"},{"forename":"Nichole N.","surname":"Barger"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"PloS ONE","firstAuthor":"Cramer"},{"id":"6048451294","title":"The Hill of Six Lakes revisited: new data and re-evaluation of a key Pleistocene Amazon site","type":"Journal Article","volume":"76","url":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0277379113002722","tags":["2013","Aichi_E","BR","Brazil","Central America_biodiversity","GBIF_primary","GBIF_used","PA","Panama","South America_biodiversity","Target_19","US"],"keywords":[],"pages":"140-155","year":"2013","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","abstract":"The new analyses of a sedimentary record of Lake Pata in the Hill of Six Lakes, in NW Amazon and its correlation with other Quaternary proxy records in the region provide new insights regarding the vegetation and climate of the lowland forest during the Last Glacial.

The variation in the saccular otolith is correlated with an increase in the number of hair bundle orientation groups on the sensory epithelia from the genera Scopelogadus to Poromitra to Melamphaes. The diverse structural variations found in the saccule may reflect the evolutionary history of these species.

Specifically, we combined plot data with herbarium records (accessed through GBIF) to test if the plots\u2019 community temperature scores (CTS, average thermal mean of constituent species weighted by basal area) have increased over the past decade as is predicted by climate-driven species migrations. In addition, we quantified the contributions of stem growth, recruitment, and mortality to the observed patterns. Supporting our a priori hypothesis of upward species migrations, we found that there have been consistent directional shifts in the composition of the plots, such that the relative abundance of lowland species, and hence CTS, increased in 90% of plots. The rate of the observed compositional shifts corresponds to a mean thermal migration rate (TMR) of 0.0065\u00b0C yr\u22121 (95% CI = 0.0005 - 0.0132\u00b0C yr\u22121).

These processes caused genetic imprints, such as a differentiation of genetic lineages and a loss of genetic diversity in the wake of (re)colonization. We used molecular markers and species distribution models (SDMs) to study the impact of range dynamics on the common wall lizard, Podarcis muralis, from southern refugia to the northern range margin. Location Parts of the Western Palaearctic. Methods We genotyped 10 polymorphic microsatellites in 282 individuals of P. muralis and sequenced the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) cytochrome b gene to study the genetic structure, divergence times and ancestral distribu- tions. Furthermore, we generated SDMs for climate scenarios for 6 and 21 ka derived from two different global circulation models. Results We detected two major mtDNA lineages \u2013 a western France clade (Pyrenees to Brittany), and an eastern France clade (southern France to Germany, Belgium and Luxembourg). This split was dated to c. 1.23 Ma. The latter clade was divided into two subclades, which diverged c. 0.38 Ma. Genetic diversity of microsatellites within each clade was nested and showed a significant loss of genetic diversity from south to north, a strong pattern of allele surfing across nearly all loci, and an increase in genetic differentiation towards the northern range margin. Results from SDMs suggest that southward range retraction during the late glacial period split the distribution into geographically distinct refugia. Main conclusions The strong genetic differentiation mirrors the effects of long-term isolation of P. muralis in multiple refugia. Post-glacial recolonization of Northern Europe has taken place from two distinct refugia, most probably along river systems (Rh^ one, Rhine, Moselle) and along the Atlantic coastline, with subsequent nested elimination of genetic diversity and increasing genetic differentiation at the northern range margin.","uuid":"cf5d167d-6b59-3ec5-91ea-c896ba15ced8","authors":[{"forename":"Franz","surname":"Gassert"},{"forename":"Ulrich","surname":"Schulte"},{"forename":"Martin","surname":"Husemann"},{"forename":"Werner","surname":"Ulrich"},{"forename":"Dennis","surname":"R\u00f6dder"},{"forename":"Axel","surname":"Hochkirch"},{"forename":"Edm\u00e9e","surname":"Engel"},{"forename":"Jobst","surname":"Meyer"},{"forename":"Jan Christian","surname":"Habel"}],"editors":[{"forename":"Aristeidis","surname":"Parmakelis"}],"publication_outlet":"Journal of Biogeography","firstAuthor":"Gassert"},{"id":"6197581814","title":"The ecology, biogeography, history and future of two globally important weeds: Cardiospermum halicacabum Linn. and C. grandiflorum Sw.","type":"Journal Article","volume":"19","url":"http:\/\/www.pensoft.net\/journals\/neobiota\/article\/5279\/abstract\/the-ecology-biogeography-history-and-future-of-two-globally-important-weeds-cardiospermum-halicacabum-linn-and-c-grandif","tags":["2013","Aichi_B","Botswana_biodiversity","GBIF_used","GBits_11","invasive","Namibia_biodiversity","South Africa","South Africa_biodiversity","species distribution","Target_9","US","ZA"],"keywords":["Balloon vines","biological invasion","C. corindum","management","phylogeny","species distribution modelling"],"pages":"45-65","year":"2013","abstract":"Members of the balloon vine genus, Cardiospermum, have been extensively moved around the globe as medicinal and horticultural species, two of which are now widespread invasive species; C. grandiflorum and C. halicacabum. A third species, C. corindum, may also have significant invasion potential. However, in some regions the native status of these species is not clear, hampering management. For example, in South Africa it is unknown whether C. halicacabum and C. corindum are native, and this is a major constraint to on-going biological control programmes against invasive C. grandiflorum. We review the geography, biology and ecology of selected members of the genus with an emphasis on the two most widespread invaders, C. halicacabum and C. grandiflorum. Specifically, we use molecular data to reconstruct a phylogeny of the group in order to shed light on the native ranges of C. halicacabum and C. corindum in southern Africa. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that southern African accessions of these species are closely related to South American taxa indicating human-mediated introduction and\/or natural long distance dispersal. Then, on a global scale we use species distribution modelling to predict potential suitable climate regions where these species are currently absent. Native range data were used to test the accuracy with which bioclimatic modelling can identify the known invasive ranges of these species. Results show that Cardiospermum species have potential to spread further in already invaded or introduced regions in Australia, Africa and Asia, underlining the importance of resolving taxonomic uncertainties for future management efforts. Bioclimatic modelling predicts Australia to have highly favourable environmental conditions for C. corindum and therefore vigilance against this species should be high. Species distribution modelling showed that native range data over fit predicted suitable ranges, and that factors other than climate influence establishment potential. This review opens the door to better understand the global biogeography of the genus Cardiospermum, with direct implications for management, while also highlighting gaps in current research.","uuid":"2b7f3779-6034-3d6f-a9a4-ff46515c3af8","authors":[{"forename":"Enelge","surname":"Gildenhuys"},{"forename":"Allan G.","surname":"Ellis"},{"forename":"Scott P.","surname":"Carroll"},{"forename":"Johannes J.","surname":"Le Roux"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"NeoBiota","firstAuthor":"Gildenhuys"},{"id":"6016483154","title":"Evolutionary lag times and recent origin of the biota of an ancient desert (Atacama-Sechura)","type":"Journal Article","url":"http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/cgi\/doi\/10.1073\/pnas.1308721110","tags":["2013","Aichi_E","Chile","CL","climate","GBIF_used","GBIF_VIP","GBits_9","South America_biodiversity","Target_19","US"],"keywords":[],"pages":"1-6","year":"2013","abstract":"The assembly of regional biotas and organismal responses to anthropogenic climate change both depend on the capacity of organisms to adapt to novel ecological conditions.

We integrate multilocus phylogeography, climate-based ENMs and multivariate statistical approaches to infer the effects of late Quaternary climate change on contemporary genetic variation of valley oak (Quercus lobata N\u00e9e). ENMs indicated that valley oak maintained a stable distribution with local migration from the last interglacial period (~120 ka) to the Last Glacial Maximum (~21 ka, LGM) to the present compared with large-scale range shifts for an eastern North American white oak (Quercus alba L.). Coast Range and Sierra Nevada foothill populations diverged in the late Pleistocene before the LGM [104 ka (28-1622)] and have occupied somewhat distinct climate niches, according to ENMs and coalescent analyses of divergence time. In accordance with neutral expectations for stable populations, nuclear microsatellite diversity positively correlated with niche stability from the LGM to present. Most strikingly, nuclear and chloroplast microsatellite variation significantly correlated with LGM climate, even after controlling for associations with geographic location and present climate using partial redundancy analyses. Variance partitioning showed that LGM climate uniquely explains a similar proportion of genetic variance as present climate (16% vs. 11-18%), and together, past and present climate explains more than geography (19%). Climate can influence local expansion-contraction dynamics, flowering phenology and thus gene flow, and\/or impose selective pressures. These results highlight the lingering effect of past climate on genetic variation in species with stable distributions.","uuid":"b73f0c8d-04ba-3122-a082-24be366d8c1d","authors":[{"forename":"Paul F.","surname":"Gugger"},{"forename":"Makihiko","surname":"Ikegami"},{"forename":"Victoria L.","surname":"Sork"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Gugger"},{"id":"6016484784","title":"Invasion of Old World Phragmites australis in the New World: precipitation and temperature patterns combined with human influences redesign the invasive niche.","type":"Journal Article","url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23765641","tags":["2013","Aichi_B","China","climate","CN","Denmark","DK","GBIF_primary","GBIF_used","GBIF_VIP","GBits_9","Global_biodiversity","invasive","in_press","plant","SDM","Target_9","US"],"keywords":[],"year":"2013","abstract":"After its introduction into North America, Euro-Asian Phragmites australis became an aggressive invasive wetland grass along the Atlantic coast of North America. Its distribution range has since expanded to the middle, south and southwest of North America, where invasive P. australis has replaced millions of hectares of native plants in inland and tidal wetlands. Another P. australis invasion from the Mediterranean region is simultaneously occurring in the Gulf region of the USA and some countries in South America. Here, we analysed the occurrence records of the two Old World invasive lineages of P. australis (Haplotype M and Med) in both their native and introduced ranges using environmental niche models (ENMs) to assess (i) whether a niche shift accompanied the invasions in the New World; (ii) the role of biologically relevant climatic variables and human influence in the process of invasion; and (iii) the current potential distribution of these two lineages. We detected local niche shifts along the East Coast of North America and the Gulf Coast of the USA for Haplotype M and around the Mississippi Delta and Florida of the USA for Med. The new niche of introduced Haplotype M accounts for temperature fluctuations and increased precipitation. The introduced Med lineage has enlarged its original subtropical niche to the tropics-subtropics, invading regions with a high annual mean temperature (> c. 10 \u00b0C) and high precipitation in the driest period. Human influence is an important factor for both niches. We suggest that an increase in precipitation in the 20(th) century, global warming and human-made habitats have shaped the invasive niches of the two lineages in the New World. However, as the invasions are on-going and human and natural disturbances occur concomitantly, the future distribution ranges of the two lineages may diverge from the potential distribution ranges detected in this study.

Results from all analyses are mostly congruent and reveal 1) a split between European and North African populations, 2) rather low divergence between populations from the eastern and western part of North Africa (Morocco vs. Tunisia), 3) a lack of differentiation between the oasis and Atlas Mountain populations, 4) as well as among the oasis populations, and 5) no reduction of genetic variability in oasis populations. However, one exception to this general trend resulted from the analyses of wing shape; wings of butterflies from oases are more elongated compared with those from the other habitats. This pattern of phenotypic divergence may suggest a recent colonization of the oasis habitats by individuals, which might be accompanied by a rather dispersive behavior. Species distribution modeling suggests a fairly recent reexpansion of the species' climatic niche starting in the Holocene at about 6000 before present. The combined results indicate a rather recent colonization of the oases by highly mobile individuals from genetically diverse founder populations. The colonization was likely followed by the expansion and persistence of these founder populations under relatively stable environmental conditions. This, together with low rates of gene flow, likely prevented differentiation of populations via drift and led to the maintenance of high genetic diversity.","uuid":"516480b9-c315-313a-8ae8-7aec2ff31bc6","authors":[{"forename":"Jan Christian","surname":"Habel"},{"forename":"Martin","surname":"Husemann"},{"forename":"Thomas","surname":"Schmitt"},{"forename":"Leonardo","surname":"Dapporto"},{"forename":"Dennis","surname":"R\u00f6dder"},{"forename":"Sofie","surname":"Vandewoestijne"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"The Journal of heredity","firstAuthor":"Habel"},{"id":"6075457404","title":"Global Climate Change Adaptation Priorities for Biodiversity and Food Security","type":"Journal Article","volume":"8","issue":"8","url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0072590","tags":["2013","agriculture","Aichi_B","birds","climate","GB","GBIF_used","GBIF_VIP","GBits_10","global_biodiversity","Korea_South","KR","New Zealand","NZ","SDM","target_7","United Kingdom","US"],"keywords":[],"pages":"e72590","year":"2013","abstract":"International policy is placing increasing emphasis on adaptation to climate change, including the allocation of new funds to assist adaptation efforts.

In response to N, Deschampsia cespitosa, a co-dominant plant in the alpine tundra at Niwot Ridge (CO), increases in abundance, while Geum rossii, its principal competitor, declines. Importantly, G. rossii declines with N even in the absence of its competitor. We examined whether contrasting host responses to N are associated with altered plant-fungal symbioses, and whether the effects of N are distinct from effects of altered plant competition on RAF using 454 pyrosequencing. Host RAF communities were very distinct (only 9.4% of OTUs overlapped). N increased RAF diversity in G. rossii, but decreased it in D. cespitosa. D. cespitosa RAF communities were more responsive to N than G. rossii RAF communities, perhaps indicating a flexible microbial community aids host adaptation to nutrient enrichment. Effects of removing D. cespitosa, were distinct from effects of N on G. rossii RAF, and D. cespitosa presence reversed RAF diversity response to N. The most dominant G. rossii RAF order, Helotiales, was the most affected by N, declining from 83% to 60% of sequences, perhaps indicating a loss of mutualists under N enrichment.

We sought to determine whether Hawaiian Artemisia (Compositae\u2013Anthemideae), which includes lowland and subalpine species, represents such an example, by investigating the origin and relationships of the Hawaiian taxa. Location: Hawaiian Islands and continental settings world-wide (except Antarctica and Australia). Methods: Molecular phylogenetic analyses of Hawaiian Artemisia in the context of world-wide diversity were conducted using nuclear and chloroplast DNA spacers. The timing of divergence events associated with inferred dispersals was estimated with calibration from fossil pollen records. Historical biogeographical analyses based on molecular trees and ecological modelling of the distributions of extant taxa were used to aid the interpretation of geographical and habitat shifts associated with diversification and long-distance dispersal. Results Our findings indicate that the Hawaiian endemic species (A. australis, A. kauaiensis and A. mauiensis) constitute a clade sister to Southeast Asian A. chinensis, which, like the Hawaiian endemics, has ribbed fruit walls and, unlike other members of Artemisia except A. kauaiensis, has a distinct pappus, which is often associated with dispersal ability in Compositae. The clade encompassing A. chinensis and Hawaiian Artemisia was resolved to be most likely of Asian origin. The natural occurrence of A. chinensis in littoral habitats of Taiwan, Okinawa, and the Ryukyu and Bonin islands, and of A. australis in similar settings in the Hawaiian Islands, is likely to reflect the ancestral ecology of the Hawaiian clade, with subsequent colonization of inland, higher-elevation habitats, including subalpine shrubland, where A. mauiensis is endemic. Main conclusions An ecological shift in Hawaiian Artemisia from tropical coastal habitats to drier and colder subalpine slopes is consistent with evidence from recent studies for repeated colonization of the Arctic by diverse lineages of Artemisia. Artemisia appears to be prone to such anticlimatic ecological shifts, which may explain this exceptional example of an ancestrally lowland tropical lineage in the Hawaiian high-montane flora.","uuid":"ece75e6d-bd77-3698-a4de-7414a3f997b3","authors":[{"forename":"Christopher R.","surname":"Hobbs"},{"forename":"Bruce G.","surname":"Baldwin"}],"editors":[{"forename":"Mark","surname":"Carine"}],"publication_outlet":"Journal of Biogeography","firstAuthor":"Hobbs"},{"id":"6082973264","title":"Phylogeography of the Robsonius Ground-Warblers (Passeriformes: Locustellidae) Reveals an Undescribed Species from Northeastern Luzon, Philippines","type":"Journal Article","volume":"115","issue":"3","url":"http:\/\/www.jstor.org\/stable\/info\/10.1525\/cond.2013.120124","tags":["2013","Aichi_E","birds","GBIF_used","Mexico","MX","PH","Philippines","Philippines_biodiversity","Target_19","taxonomy","US"],"keywords":["diversification","endemism","napothera","philippines","phylogeography"],"pages":"630-639","year":"2013","abstract":"The Robsonius ground-warblers are forest birds endemic to the Luzon Island complex in the Philippine archipelago.

Previous studies project expansion of species range for some species and local extinction elsewhere under climate change. Such range shifts raise concern for species whose long-term persistence is already threatened by other human disturbances such as fishing. However, few studies have attempted to assess the effects of future climate change on threatened vertebrate marine species using a multi-model approach. There has also been a recent surge of interest in climate change impacts on protected areas. This study applies three species distribution models and two sets of climate model projections to explore the potential impacts of climate change on marine species by 2050. A set of species in the North Sea, including seven threatened and ten major commercial species were used as a case study. Changes in habitat suitability in selected candidate protected areas around the UK under future climatic scenarios were assessed for these species. Moreover, change in the degree of overlap between commercial and threatened species ranges was calculated as a proxy of the potential threat posed by overfishing through bycatch. The ensemble projections suggest northward shifts in species at an average rate of 27 km per decade, resulting in small average changes in range overlap between threatened and commercially exploited species. Furthermore, the adverse consequences of climate change on the habitat suitability of protected areas were projected to be small. Although the models show large variation in the predicted consequences of climate change, the multi-model approach helps identify the potential risk of increased exposure to human stressors of critically endangered species such as common skate (Dipturus batis) and angelshark (Squatina squatina).","uuid":"a72cc70c-88ef-3fb4-92e6-436e22364879","authors":[{"forename":"Miranda C.","surname":"Jones"},{"forename":"Stephen R.","surname":"Dye"},{"forename":"Jose A.","surname":"Fernandes"},{"forename":"Thomas L.","surname":"Fr\u00f6licher"},{"forename":"John K.","surname":"Pinnegar"},{"forename":"Rachel","surname":"Warren"},{"forename":"William W.

We asked the question: Where will climate change have the greatest impact on three foundational, macroalgal species that occur along North-Atlantic shores: Fucus serratus, Fucus vesiculosus, and Ascophyllum nodo- sum? To predict distributional changes of these key species under three IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) climate change scenarios (A2, A1B, and B1) over the coming two centuries, we generated Ecological Niche Models with the program MAXENT.

If these foundational species are unable to adapt to the rising temperatures, they will lose their centers of genetic diversity and their loss will trigger an unpredictable shift in the North-Atlantic intertidal ecosystem.","uuid":"67768be2-2766-341a-a890-91474ec1daa3","authors":[{"forename":"Alexander","surname":"Jueterbock"},{"forename":"Lennert","surname":"Tyberghein"},{"forename":"Heroen","surname":"Verbruggen"},{"forename":"James A.","surname":"Coyer"},{"forename":"Jeanine L.","surname":"Olsen"},{"forename":"Galice","surname":"Hoarau"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Jueterbock"},{"id":"6016484434","title":"Local representation of global diversity in a cosmopolitan lichen-forming fungal species complex ( Rhizoplaca , Ascomycota)","type":"Journal Article","url":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/jbi.12118","tags":["2013","Aichi_E","CZ","Czech Republic","DE","ES","GBIF_used","GBits_8","Germany","global_biodiversity","in_press","IR","Iran","Spain","Target_19","US"],"keywords":["beast","biogeography","bpp","coalescent","correspondence","cryptic species","leavitt","long-distance dispersal","rhizoplaca melanophthalma","speciation"],"year":"2013","abstract":"Aim The relative importance of long-distance dispersal versus vicariance in determining the distribution of lichen-forming fungi remains unresolved. Here, we examined diversity and distributions in a cosmopolitan lichen-forming fungal species complex, Rhizoplaca melanophthalma sensu lato (Ascomycota), across a broad, intercontinental geographical distribution. We sought to determine the temporal context of diversification and the impacts of past climatic fluctuations on demographic dynamics within this group. Location Antarctica, Asia, Europe, North America and South America. Methods We obtained molecular sequence data from a total of 240 specimens of R. melanophthalma s.l. collected across five continents. We assessed the monophyly of candidate species using individual gene trees and a tree from a seven-locus concatenated data set. Divergence times and relationships among candidate species were evaluated using a multilocus coalescent-based species tree approach. Speciation probabilities were estimated using the coalescent-based species delimitation program bpp. We also calculated statistics on molecular diversity and population demographics for independent lineages. Main conclusions Our analyses of R. melanophthalma s.l. collected from five continents supported the presence of six species-level lineages within this complex. Based on current sampling, two of these lineages were found to have broad intercontinental distributions, while the other four were limited to western North America. Of the six lineages, five were found on a single mountain in the western USA and the sixth occurred no more than 200 km away from this mountain. Our estimates of divergence times suggest that Pleistocene glacial cycles played an important role in species diversification within this group. At least three lineages show evidence of recent or ongoing population expansion.","uuid":"6610eea7-a571-3787-bfdd-2ebc3935d20f","authors":[{"forename":"Steven D.","surname":"Leavitt"},{"forename":"Fernando","surname":"Fern\u00e1ndez-Mendoza"},{"forename":"Sergio","surname":"P\u00e9rez-Ortega"},{"forename":"Mohammad","surname":"Sohrabi"},{"forename":"Pradeep K.","surname":"Divakar"},{"forename":"Jan","surname":"Vondr\u00e1k"},{"forename":"H.","surname":"Thorsten Lumbsch"},{"forename":"Larry L.

Although the role of species diversity in the maintenance of ecosystem processes has been widely investigated, the role of rare species remains controversial. A critical issue is whether common species insure against the loss of functions supported by rare species. This issue is even more critical in species-rich ecosystems where high functional redundancy among species is likely and where it is thus often assumed that ecosystem functioning is buffered against species loss. Here, using extensive datasets of species occurrences and functional traits from three highly diverse ecosystems (846 coral reef fishes, 2,979 alpine plants, and 662 tropical trees), we demonstrate that the most distinct combinations of traits are supported predominantly by rare species both in terms of local abundance and regional occupancy. Moreover, species that have low functional redundancy and are likely to support the most vulnerable functions, with no other species carrying similar combinations of traits, are rarer than expected by chance in all three ecosystems. For instance, 63% and 98% of fish species that are likely to support highly vulnerable functions in coral reef ecosystems are locally and regionally rare, respectively. For alpine plants, 32% and 89% of such species are locally and regionally rare, respectively. Remarkably, 47% of fish species and 55% of tropical tree species that are likely to support highly vulnerable functions have only one individual per sample on average. Our results emphasize the importance of rare species conservation, even in highly diverse ecosystems, which are thought to exhibit high functional redundancy. Rare species offer more than aesthetic, cultural, or taxonomic diversity value; they disproportionately increase the potential breadth of functions provided by ecosystems across spatial scales. As such, they are likely to insure against future uncertainty arising from climate change and the ever-increasing anthropogenic pressures on ecosystems. Our results call for a more detailed understanding of the role of rarity and functional vulnerability in ecosystem functioning.","uuid":"16e05535-cd17-3ef8-9e1b-9b4b89669e51","authors":[{"forename":"David","surname":"Mouillot"},{"forename":"David R.","surname":"Bellwood"},{"forename":"Christopher","surname":"Baraloto"},{"forename":"Jerome","surname":"Chave"},{"forename":"Rene","surname":"Galzin"},{"forename":"Mireille","surname":"Harmelin-Vivien"},{"forename":"Michel","surname":"Kulbicki"},{"forename":"Sebastien","surname":"Lavergne"},{"forename":"Sandra","surname":"Lavorel"},{"forename":"Nicolas","surname":"Mouquet"},{"forename":"C.

However, predictions regarding parasitism's impacts often fail to account for the likely variability in host distribution and how this may alter parasite occurrence. Here, we investigate potential distributional shifts in the meningeal worm, Parelaphostrongylosis tenuis, a protostrongylid nematode commonly found in white-tailed deer in North America, whose lifecycle also involves a free-living stage and a gastropod intermediate host. We modelled the distribution of the hosts and free-living larva as a complete assemblage to assess whether a complex trophic system will lead to an overall increase in parasite distribution with climate change, or whether divergent environmental niches may promote an ecological mismatch. Using an ensemble approach to climate modelling under two different carbon emission scenarios, we show that while the overall trend is for an increase in niche breadth for each species, mismatches arise in habitat suitability of the free-living larva versus the definitive and intermediate hosts. By incorporating these projected mismatches into a combined model, we project a shift in parasite distribution accounting for all steps in the transmission cycle, and identify that overall habitat suitability of the parasite will decline in the Great Plains and southeastern USA, but will increase in the Boreal Forest ecoregion, particularly in Alberta. These results have important implications for wildlife conservation and management due to the known pathogenicity of parelaphostrongylosis to alternate hosts including moose, caribou and elk. Our results suggest that disease risk forecasts which fail to consider biotic interactions may be overly simplistic, and that accounting for each of the parasite's life stages is key to refining predicted responses to climate change.

We found moderate range-wide genetic diversity based on nuclear microsatellite data, and detected four well-differentiated, geographically distinct genetic groups using Bayesian clustering analyses. We modeled the ecological niche of Amborella based on current climatic and environmental conditions. The predictive ability of the model was very good throughout the Central East mainland zone, but Amborella was predicted in the northern part of the island where this plant has not been reported. Furthermore, no significant barrier was detected based on habitat suitability that could explain the genetic differentiation across the area.

Extensive reviews of the literature and manipulative experiments suggest that mangroves will be impacted by climate change, but few studies have tested these predictions over large scales using statistical models. We provide the first example of applying species and community distribution models (SDMs and CDMs, respectively) to coastal mangroves worldwide. Species distributions were modeled as ensemble forecasts using BIOMOD. Distributions of mangrove communities with high species richness were modeled in threeways: as the sum of the separate SDM outputs, as binary hotspots (with .3 species) using a generalized linear model, and continuously using a general boosted model. Individual SDMs were projected for 12 species with sufficient data and CDMs were projected for 30 species into 2080 using global climate model outputs and a range of sea-level rise projections. Species projected to shift their ranges polewards by at least 2 degrees of latitude consistently experience a decrease in the amount of suitable coastal area available to them. Central America and the Caribbean are forecast to lose more mangrove species than other parts of the world.We found that the extent and grain size, at which continuous CDMoutputs are examined, independent of the grain size at which the models operate, can dramatically influence the number of pseudo-absences needed for optimal parameterization. The SDMs and CDMs presented here provide a first approximation of how mangroves will respond to climate change given simple correlative relationships between occurrence records and environmental data. Additional, precise georeferenced data on mangrove localities and concerted efforts to collect data on ecological processes across large-scale climatic gradients will enable future research to improve upon these correlative models.","uuid":"4f1feb9e-6cba-3ca1-8c3e-e4ccf5b41175","authors":[{"forename":"S.","surname":"Record"},{"forename":"N.

By contrast, the closely related Indigo Bunting (P. cyanea) is syntopic with Painted Buntings, but its range includes the 500-km gap. To date, no well-supported hypothesis explains the gap in the range of Painted Buntings. We used MaxEnt to describe ecological niches of both species and performed comparative analyses of model results to evaluate niche similarity between the two Painted Bunting breeding populations and the range gap. All present-day niche models for both species predicted a single contiguous breeding range, which suggests that the gap in the Painted Bunting range is not bioclimatic in origin. Comparative analyses of the three different environments suggest little bioclimatic divergence. Distribution models during the Last Glacial Maximum suggest that Painted Buntings likely bred as far north as ~28\u00b0N latitude, with two disjunct populations in what are now Florida and northern Mexico. Although alternatives exist, the most parsimonious explanation is that the Gulf of Mexico serves as a migratory divide and there are fitness costs to birds attempting to fly around or over the Gulf to reach their molting or wintering grounds. This was a primary factor contributing to the origin of the current allopatric breeding distribution. Historical distribution models imply that the species may not have filled the 500-km gap as their breeding range expanded northward; divergent molting schedules may reinforce the existing range disjunction.","uuid":"593fa8b9-329b-3b2e-8d12-11bebc53cffe","authors":[{"forename":"J.","surname":"Ryan Shipley"},{"forename":"Andrea","surname":"Contina"},{"forename":"Nyambayar","surname":"Batbayar"},{"forename":"Eli S.","surname":"Bridge"},{"forename":"A.

During the Quaternary, high- and mid-latitude species were extirpated from regions that were covered by ice or otherwise became unsuitable, persisting in refugial retreats where the environment was compatible with their tolerances. In this study we combine modern geographic range data, phylogeny, Pleistocene paleoclimatic models, and isotopic records of changes in global mean annual temperature, to produce a temporally continuous model of geographic changes in potential habitat for 59 species of North American turtles over the past 320 Ka (three full glacial-interglacial cycles). These paleophylogeographic models indicate the areas where past climates were compatible with the modern ranges of the species and serve as hypotheses for how their geographic ranges would have changed in response to Quaternary climate cycles. We test these hypotheses against physiological, genetic, taxonomic and fossil evidence, and we then use them to measure the effects of Quaternary climate cycles on species distributions. Patterns of range expansion, contraction, and fragmentation in the models are strongly congruent with (i) phylogeographic differentiation; (ii) morphological variation; (iii) physiological tolerances; and (iv) intraspecific genetic variability. Modern species with significant interspecific differentiation have geographic ranges that strongly fluctuated and repeatedly fragmented throughout the Quaternary. Modern species with low genetic diversity have geographic distributions that were highly variable and at times exceedingly small in the past.

We assessed the potential role of selection in the observed geographic patterns by bioclimatically characterizing the niche of the hybrid populations and phenotypically characterizing hybrid individuals of known genomic constitution.\u2022 Key Results: Significant admixture and little overall maternal bias in chloroplast or nuclear genomes suggest a high degree of interfertility among the parental and hybrid species and point to a long history of backcrossing and genetic mixing in the hybrid zone. Even though hybrids were phenotypically intermediate to the parental species, there was a discernible fingerprint of the parental genotype within hybrid individuals. Thus, although the pattern of introgression observed suggests geographic limitations to gene flow, it may be reinforced by selection for specific parental traits in the bioclimatically intermediate habitat occupied by the hybrid.\u2022 Conclusions: This work uncovered the genetic complexity underlying the hybrid zone of the wild relatives of the cultivated strawberry. It lays the foundation for experimental dissection of the causes of genomic introgression and nuclear-cytoplasmic disassociation, and for understanding other parts of Fragaria evolutionary history.","uuid":"0dd08603-83b8-3ad0-be14-3cc590ea8b4e","authors":[{"forename":"Isabella","surname":"Salamone"},{"forename":"Rajanikanth","surname":"Govindarajulu"},{"forename":"Stacey","surname":"Falk"},{"forename":"Matthew","surname":"Parks"},{"forename":"Aaron","surname":"Liston"},{"forename":"Tia-Lynn","surname":"Ashman"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Salamone"},{"id":"6016482384","title":"Predicting the distribution of a novel bark beetle and its pine hosts under future climate conditions","type":"Journal Article","url":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/afe.12007","tags":["2013","Aichi_B","GBIF_primary","GBIF_used","GBIF_VIP","GBits_8","invasive","in_press","maxent","Mexico","Mexico_biodiversity","MX","niche_modeling","SDM","Target_9","US","USA_biodiversity"],"notes":"I did not classify this paper as invasive because the authors did not refer to the species as invasive though they did examine the future spread of the insect.

Habitat distribution (niche) models based on known occurrences provide geographical structure for such management as the environmental factors change. 2 Bark beetles play critical roles in coniferous forest dynamics in western North America. Among these insects, Dendroctonus rhizophagus Thomas and Bright, which occurs in the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico, is unique in that it attacks only immature trees (Pinus spp.) and therefore represents a threat to forest regeneration. We developed current habitat distribution models for D. rhizophagus and its Pinus hosts and projected these to future climate scenarios. 3 Predicted suitable habitat of D. rhizophagus currently covers approximately 119 000 km2 of which approximately 11% is occupied, and overlap with suitable habitat for all Pinus hosts exceeds 99.5%. Some suitable habitat occurs isolated from known D. rhizophagus occurrences in Mexico and the south-western U.S.A. 4 Habitat distribution models were projected to four potential climate scenarios for the period 2040\u20132060 and this predicted the gains and losses of suitable D. rhizophagus habitat throughout the region. Areas of north-western Mexico maintain large areas of suitable D. rhizophagus and Pinus host habitat in all scenarios. Dispersal to isolated areas of D. rhizophagus habitat appears unlikely. 5 The results of the present study can be used to target D. rhizophagus monitoring and management activities and may serve as a model for the management of other invasive species.","uuid":"190ede1d-80b5-35d6-ad3f-4738db47437a","authors":[{"forename":"Steven E.","surname":"Smith"},{"forename":"Ma.

To better understand the occurrence of monkeypox virus (MPXV), an emerging Orthopoxvirus in humans, under contemporary and future climate conditions, we used ecological niche modeling techniques in conjunction with climate and remote-sensing variables. We first created spatially explicit probability distributions of its candidate reservoir species in Africa's Congo Basin. Reservoir species distributions were subsequently used to model current and projected future distributions of human monkeypox (MPX). Results indicate that forest clearing and climate are significant driving factors of the transmission of MPX from wildlife to humans under current climate conditions. Models under contemporary climate conditions performed well, as indicated by high values for the area under the receiver operator curve (AUC), and tests on spatially randomly and non-randomly omitted test data. Future projections were made on IPCC 4th Assessment climate change scenarios for 2050 and 2080, ranging from more conservative to more aggressive, and representing the potential variation within which range shifts can be expected to occur. Future projections showed range shifts into regions where MPX has not been recorded previously. Increased suitability for MPX was predicted in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. Models developed here are useful for identifying areas where environmental conditions may become more suitable for human MPX; targeting candidate reservoir species for future screening efforts; and prioritizing regions for future MPX surveillance efforts.","uuid":"a9b46695-6748-316d-8726-2dc5be221404","authors":[{"forename":"Henri a.","surname":"Thomassen"},{"forename":"Trevon","surname":"Fuller"},{"forename":"Salvi","surname":"Asefi-Najafabady"},{"forename":"Julia a.

Location East Asia. Methods Phylogenetic analyses were carried out using four mitochondrial fragments and seven nuclear loci from 161 birds sampled from 29 localities spanning the entire geographical range of the green-backed tit. We used *beast to estimate the species tree and calculate divergence times. Extended Bayesian skyline plots were used to infer potential historical shifts in population size. We used MaxEnt to predict potential distributions during three periods: the present day, the Last Glacial Maximum and the Last Interglacial. Results The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) gene tree showed strong support for three reciprocally monophyletic groups: a south-western clade, a central clade and a Taiwanese clade. Taiwanese and Vietnamese samples had fixed differences at several nuclear loci, but the south-western and central samples shared haplotypes at all nuclear loci. The mtDNA gene tree topology differed from the species tree topology. The species tree suggested sister relationships between Taiwanese and Vietnamese operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and between south-western and central OTUs. Diversification within the green-backed tit was relatively recent, probably within the last 0.9 million years. Extended Bayesian skyline plots suggested rapid population expansion in the south-western and central phylogroups after the Last Interglacial, and this result was consistent with ecological niche models. Main conclusions Our results suggest that genetic diversification within the green-backed tit was affected by the later Pleistocene climate fluctuations. Ecological niche models indicated that the present-day vegetation distribution was, in many ways, more similar to that of the Last Glacial Maximum than it was to that of the Last Interglacial. Continental populations of the green-backed tit experienced unusual demographic and range expansion that is likely to have occurred during the cooling transition between the Last Interglacial and the Last Glacial Maximum. We found incongruence between the mtDNA gene tree and the species tree, which underscores the importance of using both mitochondrial and nuclear markers when estimating the evolutionary history of populations.","uuid":"ca8ca6ca-272c-3749-ac67-d731089f775a","authors":[{"forename":"Wenjuan","surname":"Wang"},{"forename":"Bailey D.","surname":"McKay"},{"forename":"Chuanyin","surname":"Dai"},{"forename":"Na","surname":"Zhao"},{"forename":"Ruiying","surname":"Zhang"},{"forename":"Yanhua","surname":"Qu"},{"forename":"Gang","surname":"Song"},{"forename":"Shou-Hsien","surname":"Li"},{"forename":"Wei","surname":"Liang"},{"forename":"Xiaojun","surname":"Yang"},{"forename":"Eric","surname":"Pasquet"},{"forename":"Fumin","surname":"Lei"}],"editors":[{"forename":"Michael","surname":"Patten"}],"publication_outlet":"Journal of Biogeography","firstAuthor":"Wang"},{"id":"6016484654","title":"Exotic spread of Solenopsis invicta Buren (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) beyond North America","type":"Journal Article","volume":"60","issue":"1","url":"http:\/\/periodicos.uefs.br\/ojs\/index.php\/sociobiology","tags":["2013","Aichi_B","GBIF_used","GBits_8","Global_biodiversity","invasive","Target_9","US"],"keywords":["biological invasion","exotic species","invasive species","stinging ants"],"pages":"50-55","year":"2013","abstract":"The South America fire ant Solenopsis invicta Buren arrived in Mobile, Alabama by ship sometime before 1945.

In 2001, the first Old World populations of S. invicta were dis- covered in New Zealand and Australia. Nascent populations of S. invicta in New Zealand have been exterminated and Australia populations have been kept in check through intensive control efforts. Populations of S. invicta in Taiwan and China first found in 2003-2004, however, have spread broadly. Published reports of S. invicta from Ma- laysia and Singapore were based on misidentifications, presumably of the more wide- spread Neotropical fire ant, Solenopsis geminata (Fabricius). Reports of S. invicta from India and the Philippines seem questionable and need confirmation. Where S. invicta has invaded, it has displaced S. geminata in open habitats, leaving remnant S. geminata populations, primarily in forested areas. In working to limit the spread and impacts of fire ants, it will be important to differentiate among the species, and recognize their similarities and their differences.","uuid":"a1859d7c-f3f9-3044-930d-ddda82470973","authors":[{"forename":"James K.","surname":"Wetterer"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Sociobiology","firstAuthor":"Wetterer"},{"id":"6075439354","title":"Worldwide spread of Alluaud's little yellow ant, Plagiolepis alluaudi (Hymenoptera: Formicidae)","type":"Journal Article","volume":"19","url":"http:\/\/www.myrmecologicalnews.org\/cms\/images\/pdf\/online_earlier\/mn19_53-59_non-printable.pdf","tags":["2013","Aichi_B","GBIF_used","global_biodiversity","invasive","Target_9","US"],"keywords":["Biogeography","biological invasion","exotic species","invasive species"],"pages":"53-59","year":"2013","abstract":"Abstract Plagiolepis alluaudi EMERY, 1894 is a tiny Old World ant that has spread to many parts of the world through human commerce.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service concluded that mtDNA data alone were insufficient to test subspecies taxonomy. We sequenced eight nuclear loci to search for historically discrete groupings that might have been missed by the mtDNA study (which we confirmed with new ND2 sequences). Phylogenetic analyses of the nuclear loci revealed no historically significant groupings and a low level of divergence (GST = 0.013). Sequence data suggested an older population increase in southern populations, consistent with niche modeling that suggested a northward range expansion following the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). The signal of population increase was most evident in the mtDNA data, revealing the importance of including loci with short coalescence times. The threatened subspecies inhabits the distinctive Coastal Sage Scrub ecosystem, which might indicate ecological differentiation, but a test of niche divergence was insignificant.

We present results from each method, and compare the latter three approaches for spatial coverage, biodiversity representation, fishing cost and persistence probability. All results included large areas in the north, central, and southern parts of western Madagascar. Achieving 30% representation targets with Marxan required twice the fish catch loss than the categorical method. The categorical classification and Zonation do not consider targets for conservation features. However, when we reduced Marxan targets to 16.3%, matching the representation level of the \u201cstrict protection\u201d class of the categorical result, the methods show similar catch losses. The management category portfolio has complete coverage, and presents several management recommendations including strict protection. Zonation produces rapid conservation rankings across large, diverse datasets. Marxan is useful for identifying strict protected areas that meet representation targets, and minimize exposure probabilities for conservation features at low economic cost. We show that methods based on Zonation and a simple combination of variables can produce results comparable to Marxan for species representation and catch losses, demonstrating the value of comparing alternative approaches during initial stages of the planning process. Choosing an appropriate approach ultimately depends on scientific and political factors including representation targets, likelihood of adoption, and persistence goals.","uuid":"c3ff65a8-bcd9-3362-b33d-38ec11f0de87","authors":[{"forename":"Thomas F.","surname":"Allnutt"},{"forename":"Timothy R.","surname":"McClanahan"},{"forename":"Serge","surname":"Andr\u00e9fou\u00ebt"},{"forename":"Merrill","surname":"Baker"},{"forename":"Erwann","surname":"Lagabrielle"},{"forename":"Caleb","surname":"McClennen"},{"forename":"Andry J.

We used the ecological niche model MaxEnt to test our hypothesis with Japanese honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica), a common invasive horticultural plant in the United States. We first predicted the future range expansion of the species in the United States using a model that was trained on the climate conditions in its native range. We then tested the ability of a climate-based model, which was trained on climate conditions in the invaded range, to predict the current distribution in the United States. Finally, we tested whether including a measure of human influence would improve this model. Our results indicate that, despite L. japonica\u2019s 200-year invasion history, it is expected to spread beyond its current US range.

Here, we conduct a sensitivity analysis of spatial predictions from climate envelope models for threatened and endangered vertebrates in the southeastern United States to determine whether two different downscaling approaches (with and without the use of a regional climate model) affect climate envelope model predictions when all other sources of variation are held constant. We found that prediction maps differed spatially between downscaling approaches and that the variation attributable to downscaling technique was comparable to variation between maps generated using different general circulation models (GCMs). Precipitation variables tended to show greater discrepancies between downscaling techniques than temperature variables, and for one GCM, there was evidence that more poorly resolved precipitation variables contributed relatively more to model uncertainty than more well-resolved variables. Our work suggests that ecological modelers requiring high-resolution climate projections should carefully consider the type of downscaling applied to the climate projections prior to their use in predictive ecological modeling.

We used ecological niche modeling (Maxent) to assess how three climate change scenarios published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change might affect the distribution of the threatened lace hedgehog cactus (Echinocereus reichenbachii) by the 2050s and the 2080s. Under all scenarios investigated, the total land area of suitable habitat for the species increased relative to the current land area predicted as highly suitable by the model. However, under all scenarios, the center of the most suitable area for this species shifted by 160\u2013604 km from the current location in northwest Texas, changing at a rate 20\u201375 km per decade. While the rate of dispersal in this species is not known, Echinocereus spp. seeds are typically spread by small mammals and it seems unlikely that this species will be able to disperse rapidly. Consequently, the range may initially contract during the coming century, especially in southern Texas where it is most imperiled and where the climate is predicted to become increasingly unsuitable. The current patchiness of distribution of the species suggests that microhabitat characteristics and limitations to dispersal might reduce its actual realized niche relative to the fundamental niche indicated by the models. In addition, land use for agriculture, grazing, and urbanization might further reduce the success of this species in a changing climate.","uuid":"d8e1208c-fc5e-301f-8e9e-13c5612af819","authors":[{"forename":"Christopher J.","surname":"Butler"},{"forename":"Eric A.","surname":"Wheeler"},{"forename":"L.

A possible explanation for this pattern is that the narrow thermal tolerances of tropical species and greater climatic stratification of tropical mountains create more opportunities for climate-associated parapatric or allopatric speciation in the tropics relative to the temperate zone. However, it is unclear whether a general relationship exists among latitude, climatic zonation and the ecology of speciation. Recent taxon-specific studies obtained different results regarding the role of climate in speciation in tropical versus temperate areas. Here, we quantify overlap in the climatic distributions of 93 pairs of sister species of mammals, birds, amphibians and reptiles restricted to either the New World tropics or to the Northern temperate zone. We show that elevational ranges of tropical- and temperate-zone species do not differ from one another, yet the temperature range experienced by species in the temperate zone is greater than for those in the tropics. Moreover, tropical sister species tend to exhibit greater similarity in their climatic distributions than temperate sister species. This pattern suggests that evolutionary conservatism in the thermal niches of tropical taxa, coupled with the greater thermal zonation of tropical mountains, may result in increased opportunities for allopatric isolation, speciation and the accumulation of species in tropical montane regions. Our study exemplifies the power of combining phylogenetic and spatial datasets of global climatic variation to explore evolutionary (rather than purely ecological) explanations for the high biodiversity of tropical montane regions.","uuid":"3cbc26c3-f118-3b8a-9b77-f3e24c5799e5","authors":[{"forename":"Carlos Daniel","surname":"Cadena"},{"forename":"Kenneth H.","surname":"Kozak"},{"forename":"Juan Pablo","surname":"G\u00f3mez"},{"forename":"Juan Luis","surname":"Parra"},{"forename":"Christy M.","surname":"McCain"},{"forename":"Rauri C.

Within problem formulation, the insecticidal trait, the crop, the receiving environment, and protection goals were characterized, and a conceptual model was developed to identify routes through which aquatic organisms may be exposed to insecticidal proteins in maize tissue. Following a tiered approach for exposure assessment, worst-case exposures were estimated using standardized models, and factors mitigating exposure were described. Based on exposure estimates, shredders were identified as the functional group most likely to be exposed to insecticidal proteins. However, even using worst-case assumptions, the exposure of shredders to Bt maize was low and studies supporting the current risk assessments were deemed adequate. Determining if early tier toxicity studies are necessary to inform the risk assessment for a specific GM crop should be done on a case by case basis, and should be guided by thorough problem formulation and exposure assessment. The processes used to develop the Bt maize case study are intended to serve as a model for performing risk assessments on future traits and crops.","uuid":"e35486bb-9372-3f20-8e6f-cc24005e31e4","authors":[{"forename":"Keri","surname":"Carstens"},{"forename":"Jennifer","surname":"Anderson"},{"forename":"Pamela","surname":"Bachman"},{"forename":"Adinda","surname":"De Schrijver"},{"forename":"Galen","surname":"Dively"},{"forename":"Brian","surname":"Federici"},{"forename":"Mick","surname":"Hamer"},{"forename":"Marco","surname":"Gielkens"},{"forename":"Peter","surname":"Jensen"},{"forename":"William","surname":"Lamp"},{"forename":"Stefan","surname":"Rauschen"},{"forename":"Geoff","surname":"Ridley"},{"forename":"J\u00f6rg","surname":"Romeis"},{"forename":"Annabel","surname":"Waggoner"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Transgenic Research","firstAuthor":"Carstens"},{"id":"6016482394","title":"SpeciesMap: a web-based application for visualizing the overlap of distributions and pollution events, with a list of fishes put at risk by the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill","type":"Journal Article","volume":"21","issue":"7","url":"http:\/\/www.springerlink.com\/index\/10.1007\/s10531-012-0284-4","tags":["2012","Aichi_B","conservation","GBIF_used","GBIF_VIP","marine","supplement","Target_8","university","US","USA_biodiversity"],"keywords":["Deep sea","Deepwater Horizon","Macondo blowout"],"pages":"1865-1876","year":"2012","abstract":"The 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill was the largest in history outside of warfare and because the spill occurred in the deep sea, its impact on the biota will be difficult to assess.

Wetland ecosystems are particularly in need of such monitoring due to their sensitivity to rainfall, water management and other external factors that affect hydrology, soil, and species patterns. A key challenge for environmental scientists is determining the linkage between natural and human stressors, and the effect of that linkage at the species level in space and time. We propose pixel intensity based Shannon entropy for estimating species-richness, and introduce a method based on statistical wavelet multiresolution texture analysis to quantitatively assess interseasonal and interannual species turnover. We model satellite images of regions of interest as textures. We define a texture in an image as a spatial domain where the variations in pixel intensity across the image are both stochastic and multiscale. To compare two textures quantitatively, we first obtain a multiresolution wavelet decomposition of each. Either an appropriate probability density function (pdf) model for the coefficients at each subband is selected, and its parameters estimated, or, a non-parametric approach using histograms is adopted. We choose the former, where the wavelet coefficients of the multiresolution decomposition at each subband are modeled as samples from the generalized Gaussian pdf. We then obtain the joint pdf for the coefficients for all subbands, assuming independence across subbands; an approximation that simplifies the computational burden significantly without sacrificing the ability to statistically distinguish textures. We measure the difference between two textures\u2019 representative pdf\u2019s via the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL). Species turnover, or b diversity, is estimated using both this KL divergence and the difference in Shannon entropy. Additionally, we predict species richness, or a diversity, based on the Shannon entropy of pixel intensity.To test our approach, we specifically use the green band of Landsat images for a water conservation area in the Florida Everglades. We validate our predictions against data of species occurrences for a twenty-eight years long period for both wet and dry seasons. Our method correctly predicts 73% of species richness. For species turnover, the newly proposed KL divergence prediction performance is near 100% accurate. This represents a significant improvement over the more conventional Shannon entropy difference, which provides 85% accuracy. Furthermore, we find that changes in soil and water patterns, as measured by fluctuations of the Shannon entropy for the red and blue bands respectively, are positively correlated with changes in vegetation. The fluctuations are smaller in the wet season when compared to the dry season. Texture-based statistical multiresolution image analysis is a promising method for quantifying interseasonal differences and, consequently, the degree to which vegetation, soil, and water patterns vary. The proposed automated method for quantifying species richness and turnover can also provide analysis at higher spatial and temporal resolution than is currently obtainable from expensive monitoring campaigns, thus enabling more prompt, more cost effective inference and decision making support regarding anomalous variations in biodiversity. Additionally, a matrix-based visualization of the statistical multiresolution analysis is presented to facilitate both insight and quick recognition of anomalous data.","uuid":"8a56b1bb-159b-3612-944c-3c203cf9013f","authors":[{"forename":"Matteo","surname":"Convertino"},{"forename":"Rami S.","surname":"Mangoubi"},{"forename":"Igor","surname":"Linkov"},{"forename":"Nathan C.","surname":"Lowry"},{"forename":"Mukund","surname":"Desai"}],"editors":[{"forename":"Kimberly Patraw","surname":"Van Niel"}],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Convertino"},{"id":"6016483534","title":"The Endemic Plants of Micronesia: A Geographical Checklist and Commentary","type":"Journal Article","volume":"43","issue":"1","url":"http:\/\/www.uog.edu\/up\/micronesica\/dynamicdata\/assetmanager\/images\/vol43\/costion.lorence micronesica 43%281%29.pdf","tags":["2012","Aichi_E","AU","Australia","GBIF_used","GBits_32","Micronesia_biodiversity","plants","Target_19","US"],"keywords":[],"pages":"51-100","year":"2012","abstract":"The Micronesia-Polynesia bioregion is recognized as a global biodiversity hotspot.

Using field data on the growth of Astrangia poculata over an annual period near its northern range limit in Rhode Island, USA, we tested the hypothesis that the distribution of this coral is limited by low temperature. A simple model based on satellite sea surface temperature and field growth data at monthly temporal resolution was used to estimate annual net coral growth north and south of the known range limit of A. poculata. Annual net coral growth was the result of new polyp budding above ~10 \u00b0C minus polyp loss below ~10 \u00b0C, which is caused by a state of torpor that leads to overgrowth by encroaching and settling organisms. The model accurately predicted A. poculata\u2019s range limit around Cape Cod, Massachusetts, predicting no net growth northward as a result of corals\u2019 inability to counteract polyp loss during winter with sufficient polyp budding during summer. The model also indicated that the range limit of A. poculata coincides with a decline in the benefit of associating with symbiotic dinoflagellates (Symbiodinium B2\/S. psygmophilum), suggesting that symbiosis may become a liability under colder temperatures. While we cannot exclude the potential role of other coral life history traits or environmental factors in setting A. poculata\u2019s northern range limit, our analysis suggests that low temperature constrains the growth and persistence of adult corals and would preclude coral growth northward of Cape Cod.","uuid":"36437c3f-cfb9-3af3-a5d6-33b32a5263a0","authors":[{"forename":"J.

Despite their obvious conservation values, properties of these datasets are poorly understood. We use plant databases from three different well-established inventories [rare plants in California (CA), Spanish threatened plants (SP) and the Proteaceae in South Africa (SA)] to explore the behavior of large data sets in facilitating the link between current field surveys and future standardized monitoring methods. We analyze area frequency curves of the species area size for each data set and for a series of extracted databases from each inventory. Our results show that all field surveys produced left-skewed frequency distributions. A lognormal distribution is better fitted by SA, followed by CA and finally by SP, which is least suited to a lognormal fit. Using the most threatened portion of the three floras, these general patterns still apply. Secondly, a minimum sample analysis indicates that precision increases according to sample size. Proportionally, CA data require less sampling effort than the Spanish pool and the latter require less than do SA in order to get a clear monitoring trend. Larger skewness values are related to inventories with wider scope. SA Proteas display the most skewed distribution. Skewness in California may be explained not only by the nature and scope of the inventory but also by the scale used for mapping. The Spanish database is also affected by surveyor bias towards the most endangered portion of the data set. Monitoring should take into account the original nature of each inventory. Particular inventory methods and scope may produce different outputs, constraining future monitoring programs. Key aspects are skewness and variation, and both combined could identify inventories in need of better data collection practices for more precise estimates of changes in biodiversity.","uuid":"4b8f0974-ad26-3d68-ac65-54c24758a8ac","authors":[{"forename":"F.","surname":"Dom\u00ednguez Lozano"},{"forename":"A.

Because unionoid bivalves are one of the most imperiled groups of animals in the world, understanding the genetic variation within and among populations as well as among species is crucial for effective conservation planning. Conservation of unionoid species is indispensable from a freshwater habitat perspective but also because they possess a unique mitochondrial inheritance system where distinct gender-associated mitochondrial DNA lineages coexist: a female-transmitted (F) mt genome and a male-transmitted (M) mt genome that are involved in the maintenance of separate sexes (=dioecy). In this study, 42 populations of Pyganodon sp. were sampled across a large geographical range and fragments of two mitochondrial genes (cox1 and cox2) were sequenced from both the M- and F-transmitted mtDNA genomes. Our results support the recency of the divergence between P. cataracta and P. fragilis. We also found two relatively divergent F and M lineages within P. grandis. Surprisingly, the relationships among the P. grandis specimens in the F and M sequence trees are not congruent. We found that a single haplotype in P. lacustris has recently swept throughout the M genotype space leading to an unexpectedly low diversity in the M lineage in that species. Our survey put forward some challenging results that force us to rethink hybridization and species boundaries in the genus Pyganodon. As the M and F genomes do not always display the same phylogeographic story in each species, we also discuss the importance of being careful in the interpretation of molecular data based solely on maternal transmitted mtDNA genomes. The involvement of F and M genomes in unionoid bivalve sex determination likely played a role in the genesis of the unorthodox phylogeographic patterns reported herein.","uuid":"e00387b4-6aaa-356d-a711-48ce596e6633","authors":[{"forename":"H\u00e9l\u00e8ne","surname":"Doucet-Beaupr\u00e9"},{"forename":"Pierre U.","surname":"Blier"},{"forename":"Eric G.","surname":"Chapman"},{"forename":"Helen","surname":"Piontkivska"},{"forename":"France","surname":"Dufresne"},{"forename":"Bernard E.","surname":"Sietman"},{"forename":"Renee S.","surname":"Mulcrone"},{"forename":"Walter R.","surname":"Hoeh"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution","firstAuthor":"Doucet-Beaupr\u00e9"},{"id":"6016482284","title":"Angiosperm Responses to a Low-CO2 World: CAM and C4 Photosynthesis as Parallel Evolutionary Trajectories","type":"Journal Article","volume":"173","issue":"6","url":"http:\/\/www.jstor.org\/stable\/10.1086\/666098","tags":["2012","GBIF_primary","GBIF_used","plants","US"],"keywords":[],"pages":"724-733","year":"2012","abstract":"Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) and C4 photosynthetic syndromes have much in common: they employ a shared biochemical pathway that enables the concentration of CO2 inside plant cells, they are both considered to be adaptations to stressful environments, and they are both arguably among the most convergent of complex traits, having each evolved multiple times in various plant lineages. They are also both signature elements of stress-adapted floras the world over and play fundamental roles in the ecological success of flowering plants. In spite of these similarities, the obvious phenotypic and ecological differences between certain groups of fully optimized C4 and CAM plants have led us to generally view these syndromes as very distinct ecological adaptations. A broad look at the distribution of CAM and C4 plants across a very large phylogeny of angiosperms highlights that while CAM photosynthesis seems to have evolved more often, both CAM and C4 origins show tight and overlapping clustering in many regions of the tree, suggesting that certain plant lineages are prone to evolve either pathway. Additionally, recent phylogenetic analyses revealed that the origins and diversification of many CAM and C4 lineages were recent and contemporaneous in time. We postulate that the evolutionary \u201cstarting points\u201d for CAM and C4 pathways could be much more similar than typically acknowledged. Using species with C3-C4 and CAM-like intermediate phenotypes as models of CAM and C4 evolution has been productive, but the distinct advantages that each affords may have promoted rapid ecological divergence that subsequently masked any shared ancestral characteristics between the two pathways. Focusing on newly discovered phylogenetic \u201chotbeds\u201d of CAM and C4 evolution will allow for inclusion of relevant C3 taxa and a finer evaluation of the possible environmental and organismal traits that would strongly favor the evolution of one syndrome over the other.","uuid":"599b9ec7-e5eb-3798-aa80-ce907e03bdf7","authors":[{"forename":"Erika J.","surname":"Edwards"},{"forename":"R.

I test for changes in the thermal distributions of 239 South American tropical plant species using dated herbarium records for specimens collected between 1970 and 2009. Supporting a priori predictions, many species (59%) exhibit some evidence of significant cold-ward range shifts even after correcting for collection biases. Over 1\/3 of species (35%) show significant cold-ward movement in their hot thermal limits (mean rate of change = 0.022\u00b0C yr\u22121). Most of these species (85%; 30% of all study species) show no corresponding shift in their cold thermal limits. These unbalanced changes in the species\u2019 thermal range limits may indicate species that are experiencing dieback due to their intolerance of rising temperatures coupled with an inability to expand into newly climatically-suitable habitats. On the other hand, 25% of species show significant cold-ward shifts in their cold thermal range limits (mean rate of change = 0.003\u00b0C yr\u22121), but 80% of these species (20% of all study species) show no corresponding shift in their hot thermal range limits. In these cases, the unbalanced shifts may indicate species that are able to \u201cbenefit\u201d under global warming, at least temporally, by both tolerating rising temperatures and expanding into new suitable habitat. An important ancillary result of this study is that the number of species exhibiting significant range shifts was greatly influenced by shifting collector biases.

We find that the future of Amazonian diversity will be dependant primarily on the ability of species to tolerate or adapt to rising temperatures. If the thermal niches of tropical plants are fixed and incapable of expanding under rapid warming, then the negative effects of climate change will overshadow the effects of deforestation, greatly reducing the area of suitable habitat available to most species and potentially leading to massive losses of biodiversity throughout the Amazon. If tropical species are generally capable of tolerating warmer temperatures, rates of habitat loss will be greatly reduced but many parts of Amazonia may still experience rapid losses of diversity, with the effects of enhanced seasonal water stress being similar in magnitude to the effects of deforestation.","uuid":"db36e222-7992-3580-bd8b-fd2718617e00","authors":[{"forename":"Kenneth J.","surname":"Feeley"},{"forename":"Yadvinder","surname":"Malhi"},{"forename":"Przemyslaw","surname":"Zelazowski"},{"forename":"Miles R.","surname":"Silman"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Global Change Biology","firstAuthor":"Feeley"},{"id":"6016484904","title":"Does adding multi-scale climatic variability improve our capacity to explain niche transferability in invasive species?","type":"Journal Article","volume":"246","url":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0304380012003742","tags":["2012","Aichi_E","GBIF_used","global_biodiversity","invasive","niche_modeling","SDM","Target_19","university","US"],"keywords":["Inter-annual variability","Introduced species","Invasive species","Monthly variability","Niche transferability","Non-indigenous species","Species distribution modeling"],"pages":"60-67","year":"2012","publisher":"Elsevier B.V.","abstract":"Our understanding of how species will respond to global change is still limited.

Here we present a multi-taxon analysis of invasive species niche transferability that considers multi-scale climatic variability using ten noxious terrestrial invasive species. We compare native versus invasive ranges in geographic space as estimated using the species distribution modeling (SDM) algorithm Maxent, and the comparative index Hellinger's I with three possible climatic layer configurations representing natural climatic variability: (1) inter-annual, (2) monthly and (3) a combination of inter-annual and monthly climatic variability. We assess model performance using the area under the receiver characteristic curve (AUC). Results show that combined scales of climatic variability improved performance of the models for 60% of the species in the native range and 70% of the species in the invaded range. Contrasting native and invaded range SDM performance showed that the same climate layer configuration produced the best models only in 70% of the species.

The divergence in our findings between higher performing SDMs and the most transferable SDMs, suggest some species range limits might be constrained by one scale of climatic variability in the native range and a different one in the invaded range. Where sufficient occurrence data in the invaded range is available, the inclusion of an additional scale of climatic variability can enhance ecological understanding of the invasion events. However, when invaded range occurrence data is not available, the most conservative approach would use only monthly climatic variability. If these finding are extrapolated to niche transferability in time, we suggest that historical collection records should be analyzed to understand species\u2019 response to multiple scales of climate variability in the past, thereby informing the selection of appropriate scales of climate variability in the future.","uuid":"78f31381-a11d-3c77-ad7a-f1c23c8d6909","authors":[{"forename":"Miguel","surname":"Fern\u00e1ndez"},{"forename":"Healy","surname":"Hamilton"},{"forename":"Otto","surname":"Alvarez"},{"forename":"Qinghua","surname":"Guo"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Fern\u00e1ndez"},{"id":"6016482354","title":"Cryptic extinction of a common Pacific lizard Emoia impar (Squamata, Scincidae) from the Hawaiian Islands","type":"Journal Article","volume":"46","issue":"02","url":"http:\/\/journals.cambridge.org\/abstract_S0030605310001778\nhttp:\/\/www.journals.cambridge.org\/abstract_S0030605310001778","tags":["2012","Aichi_B","conservation","FR","France","GBIF_used","Hawaii_biodiversity","invasive","museum","reptiles","Target_9","US","USA_biodiversity","USGS"],"keywords":["Emoia impar","Hawaiian Islands","invasive ants","Lampropholis delicata","lizard extinction","Pheidole mega- cephala","Scincidae"],"pages":"187-195","year":"2012","abstract":"Most documented declines of tropical reptiles are of dramatic or enigmatic species.

The early (1900s) decline and extinction of the common Pacific skink Emoia impar from the Hawaiian Islands is documented here through an assessment of literature, museum vouchers and recent fieldwork. This decline appears contemporaneous with the documented declines of invertebrates and birds across the Hawaiian Islands. A review of the plausible causal factors indicates that the spread of the introduced big-headed ant Pheidole megacephala is the most likely factor in this lizard decline. The introduction and spread of a similar skink Lampropholis delicata across the islands appears to temporally follow the decline of E. impar, although there is no evidence of competition between these species. It appears that L. delicata is spreading to occupy the niche vacated by the extirpated E. impar. Further confusion exists because the skink E. cyanura, which is very similar in appearance to E. impar, appears to have been introduced to one site within a hotel on Kaua\u2019i and persisted as a population at that site for approximately 2 decades (1970s\u2013 1990s) but is now also extirpated.

However, the knowledge of the taxonomy, distribution, and ethnobotany of these and related species is incomplete. This article presents the distribution of the genus in Mexico according to its internationally accepted taxonomic identity. The distribution is linked to environmental variables such as elevation, climate type, soil, and soil moisture patterns. In addition to showing the current taxonomical knowledge in Mexico, this article discusses its biogeography, its traditional uses and the research lines to follow in further study of the genus. The distribution results show that some species are broadly adapted; as a consequence, they are present in many different environments. Species such as J. dioica, J. curcas, J. cordata, J. cinerea and J. gaumeri are distributed in areas with well defined environmental conditions. However, the distribution of species such as J. riojae has not yet been ascertained. Three areas with high species richness were identified, and they are very important for the study and conservation of the genus. Mexico is a global center of diversity for this genus. Food and medicinal uses have been reported for some species. This article concludes with recommendations for further study to improve the knowledge of this genus in Mexico.","uuid":"4b1b8113-036f-371c-8bbd-d39bdaa34047","authors":[{"forename":"J.","surname":"Fresnedo-Ram\u00edrez"},{"forename":"Q.","surname":"Orozco-Ram\u00edrez"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Fresnedo-Ram\u00edrez"},{"id":"6016483674","title":"Near-present and future distribution of Anopheles albimanus in Mesoamerica and the Caribbean Basin modeled with climate and topographic data.","type":"Journal Article","volume":"11","url":"http:\/\/www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov\/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3416578&tool=pmcentrez&rendertype=abstract","tags":["2012","Caribbean_biodiversity","CO","Colombia","GBIF_used","human health","Meso America_biodiversity","US"],"keywords":[],"pages":"13","year":"2012","abstract":"Background: Anopheles albimanus is among the most important vectors of human malaria in Mesoamerica and the Caribbean Basin (M-C).

Results The projected near-present distribution parameterized with 314 presence points related well to the known geographic distribution in the study region. Different model experiments suggest that the range of An. albimanus based on near-present climate surfaces covered at least 1.27 million km2 in the M-C, although 2080 range was projected to decrease to 1.19 million km2. Modeled p(s) was generally highest in Mesoamerica where many of the original specimens were collected. MaxEnt projected near-present maximum elevation at 1,937 m whereas 2080 maximum elevation was projected at 2,118 m. 2080 climate scenarios generally showed increased p(s) in Mesoamerica, although results varied for northern South America and no major range expansion into the mid-latitudes was projected by 2080. Conclusions MaxEnt experiments with near present and future climate data suggest that An. albimanus is likely to invade high-altitude (>2,000 m) areas by 2080 and therefore place many more people at risk of malaria in the M-C region even though latitudinal range expansion may be limited.","uuid":"d8940705-4157-3936-86f4-52ea7890f76a","authors":[{"forename":"Douglas O.","surname":"Fuller"},{"forename":"Martha L.","surname":"Ahumada"},{"forename":"Martha L.","surname":"Qui\u00f1ones"},{"forename":"S\u00f3crates","surname":"Herrera"},{"forename":"John C.","surname":"Beier"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Fuller"},{"id":"6016482694","title":"Interbasin Water Transfer, Riverine Connectivity, and Spatial Controls on Fish Biodiversity","type":"Journal Article","volume":"7","issue":"3","url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0034170","tags":["2012","biogeography","climate","conservation","freshwater fish","GBIF_used","GBIF_VIP","IN","India","India_biodiversity","niche_modeling","SDM","supplement","university","US","USGS"],"notes":"used Fish Base and GBIF? what is the overlap?","keywords":[],"pages":"e34170","year":"2012","abstract":"Background Large-scale inter-basin water transfer (IBWT) projects are commonly proposed as solutions to water distribution and supply problems. These problems are likely to intensify under future population growth and climate change scenarios. Scarce data on the distribution of freshwater fishes frequently limits the ability to assess the potential implications of an IBWT project on freshwater fish communities. Because connectivity in habitat networks is expected to be critical to species' biogeography, consideration of changes in the relative isolation of riverine networks may provide a strategy for controlling impacts of IBWTs on freshwater fish communities. Methods\/Principal Findings Using empirical data on the current patterns of freshwater fish biodiversity for rivers of peninsular India, we show here how the spatial changes alone under an archetypal IBWT project will (1) reduce freshwater fish biodiversity system-wide, (2) alter patterns of local species richness, (3) expand distributions of widespread species throughout peninsular rivers, and (4) decrease community richness by increasing inter-basin similarity (a mechanism for the observed decrease in biodiversity). Given the complexity of the IBWT, many paths to partial or full completion of the project are possible. We evaluate two strategies for step-wise implementation of the 11 canals, based on economic or ecological considerations. We find that for each step in the project, the impacts on freshwater fish communities are sensitive to which canal is added to the network. Conclusions\/Significance Importantly, ecological impacts can be reduced by associating the sequence in which canals are added to characteristics of the links, except for the case when all 11 canals are implemented simultaneously (at which point the sequence of canal addition is inconsequential). By identifying the fundamental relationship between the geometry of riverine networks and freshwater fish biodiversity, our results will aid in assessing impacts of IBWT projects and balancing ecosystem and societal demands for freshwater, even in cases where biodiversity data are limited.","uuid":"ec7c8cc2-6af0-3c03-940b-8d9aa4afb8ed","authors":[{"forename":"Evan H.

With regards to elevational changes, most studies have either re-sampled historical systematic survey sites or analyzed time series of occurrence data at long-term study sites. Such data sources are unavailable for most tropical mountains, so other methods of detecting elevational changes must be sought. Here we combine data from published checklists, recent fi eld work, peer-reviewed literature, unpublished reports, birdwatchers\u2019 trip reports, databases of birdwatchers\u2019 observations, audio recordings, and photographs to compare historical (pre-1998) and current (post-2006) bird distributions on Mt. Kinabalu in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. Records were carefully checked by experts on Bornean birds. More species are now known from Mt. Kinabalu, but historical data provided elevational range estimates for more species than current data because of extensive mountain-wide collections and surveys. Most elevational comparisons for this study had to be limited to the 1450\u20131900 m elevational band, where most of the recent work has been done. Information was compiled into an annotated list of 342 species from 200\u20134095 m. We present this list to encourage refi nement of the dataset and future work on elevational distributions on the mountain. Of 58 species with suffi cient data from 1450 m to the summit, 38 appear to have shifted their ranges (24 species upslope and 14 downslope). A total of 22 resident species have recently been observed above their published maximum elevation for Borneo. Some species that have shifted upwards, such as Chalcophaps indica and Pellorneum pyrrogenys, are now common or breeding at elevations above their published maximum. Fifteen species appear to have declined on the mountain, probably as a result of habitat loss outside the protected area. Several of the upslope shifts are probably attributable to climate change, but many downslope shifts may be artifacts of incomplete recent sampling. The upward shifts agree with the few other tropical range comparisons that have been published. Our approach demonstrates the viability of combining diverse data sources (of varying accuracy and bias) to detect distributional shifts from climate change.","uuid":"69f5e77e-38de-3dba-be86-a0ad5be784ff","authors":[{"forename":"J Berton C.","surname":"Harris"},{"forename":"Ding Li","surname":"Yong"},{"forename":"Frederick H.","surname":"Sheldon"},{"forename":"Andy J.","surname":"Boyce"},{"forename":"James A.","surname":"Eaton"},{"forename":"Henry","surname":"Bernard"},{"forename":"Alim","surname":"Biun"},{"forename":"Angela","surname":"Langevin"},{"forename":"Thomas E.","surname":"Martin"},{"forename":"Dan","surname":"Wei"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"The Raffles Bulletin of Zoology","firstAuthor":"Harris"},{"id":"6016483194","title":"Clonality Despite Sex: The Evolution of Host-Associated Sexual Neighborhoods in the Pathogenic Fungus Penicillium marneffei","type":"Journal Article","volume":"8","issue":"10","url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.ppat.1002851","tags":["2012","AU","Australia","China","Chinese Taipei","CN","GB","GBIF_used","GBIF_VIP","HK","Hong Kong","human health","IN","India","Taiwan","TH","Thailand","TW","US","Vietnam","Vietnam_biodiversity","VN"],"keywords":[],"pages":"e1002851","year":"2012","uuid":"65109d26-c5e7-3095-96e8-57a3c570a0c3","authors":[{"forename":"Daniel A.","surname":"Henk"},{"forename":"Revital","surname":"Shahar-Golan"},{"forename":"Khuraijam Ranjana","surname":"Devi"},{"forename":"Kylie J.","surname":"Boyce"},{"forename":"Nengyong","surname":"Zhan"},{"forename":"Natalie D.","surname":"Fedorova"},{"forename":"William C.","surname":"Nierman"},{"forename":"Po-Ren","surname":"Hsueh"},{"forename":"Kwok-Yung","surname":"Yuen"},{"forename":"Tran P.

Many of these are important foundation species, structuring hard-bottom benthic ecosystems. Theoretically, differences in the genetic composition of their populations vary geographically and with depth. Previous studies have examined the genetic diversity of some of these taxa in a regional context, suggesting that genetic differentiation does not occur at scales of discrete features such as seamounts or canyons, but at larger scales (e.g. ocean basins). However, to date, few studies have evaluated such diversity throughout the known distribution of a putative deep-sea species. We utilized sequences from seven mitochondrial gene regions and nuclear genetic variants of the deep-sea coral Paragorgia arborea in a phylogeographic context to examine the global patterns of genetic variation and their possible correlation with the spatial variables of geographic position and depth. We also examined the compatibility of this morphospecies with the genealogical-phylospecies concept by examining specimens collected worldwide. We show that the morphospecies P. arborea can be defined as a genealogical-phylospecies, in contrast to the hypothesis that P. arborea represents a cryptic species complex. Genetic variation is correlated with geographic location at the basin-scale level, but not with depth. Additionally, we present a phylogeographic hypothesis in which P. arborea originates from the North Pacific, followed by colonization of the Southern Hemisphere prior to migration to the North Atlantic. This hypothesis is consistent with the latest ocean circulation model for the Miocene.","uuid":"061447fb-e521-36b3-b417-e347fff7dabf","authors":[{"forename":"S\u00f3crates","surname":"Herrera"},{"forename":"T.

We investigated the extent to which the climatic origins of populations from four live oak species (Quercus series Virentes) were associated with freezing tolerance and growth rate, and whether species fitted a model of locally adapted populations, each with narrow climatic tolerances, or of broadly adapted populations with wide climatic tolerances. Acorns from populations of four species across a tropical-temperate gradient were grown under common tropical and temperate conditions. Growth rate, seed mass, and leaf and stem freezing traits were compared with source minimum temperatures. Maximum growth rates under tropical conditions were negatively correlated with freezing tolerance under temperate conditions. The minimum source temperature predicted the freezing tolerance of populations under temperate conditions. The tropical species Q. oleoides was differentiated from the three temperate species, and variation among species was greater than among populations. The trade-off between freezing tolerance and growth rate supports the range limit hypothesis. Limited variation within species indicates that the distributions of species may be driven more strongly by broad climatic factors than by highly local conditions.","uuid":"1df5c62d-ee74-3b2b-91d9-9fce4ecfbb94","authors":[{"forename":"Kari","surname":"Koehler"},{"forename":"Alyson","surname":"Center"},{"forename":"Jeannine","surname":"Cavender-Bares"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"The New Phytologist","firstAuthor":"Koehler"},{"id":"6016483204","title":"Hydroclimatic and hydrochemical controls on Plecoptera diversity and distribution in northern freshwater ecosystems","type":"Journal Article","volume":"693","issue":"1","url":"http:\/\/www.springerlink.com\/index\/10.1007\/s10750-012-1085-1","tags":["2012","Aichi_E","CA","Canada","CH","climate","freshwater","GB","GBIF_used","GB_biodiversity","SE","Sweden","Switzerland","Target_19","university","US","USGS"],"keywords":["Alpha diversity","Catchment inter-comparison","Climate change","Hydroclimatic","Northern temperate regions","Plecoptera","Streamflow"],"pages":"39-53","year":"2012","abstract":"Freshwater ecosystems in the mid- to upper-latitudes of the northern hemisphere are particularly vulnerable to the impact of climate change as slight changes in air temperature can alter the form, timing, and magnitude of precipitation and consequent influence of snowmelt on streamflow dynamics.

Location Global. Methods Using the globally invasive crayfishes Pacifastacus leniusculus and Pro- cambarus clarkii as our avatar invaders, we quantify how niche position, size and structure differs between native and total ranges using Mahalanobis distance (a measure of multivariate similarity) and the climate predictors of annual minimum and maximum air temperature. We then generalize patterns of niche shift from these species to the emerging crayfish invader Cherax quadricarinatus. Results Some patterns of niche shifts were similar for Pacifastacus leniusculus and Procambarus clarkii, but niche shifts were of considerably greater magnitude for P. clarkii. When a native range model for C. quadricarinatus was modified with generalized niche shifts similar to Pacifastacus leniusculus and Procambarus clarkii, the potential global distribution for this species increased considerably, including many areas not identified by the native range model.

Despite these research needs, we believe this concept will have considerable utility for predicting vulnerability to invasion by data-poor species; this is a critical management need because shifting pathways of introduction and climate change will produce many novel, emerging invasive species in the future.","uuid":"a54275d9-f920-3113-ba81-6a80835997f6","authors":[{"forename":"Eric R.","surname":"Larson"},{"forename":"Julian D.","surname":"Olden"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Global Ecology and Biogeography","firstAuthor":"Larson"},{"id":"6016482674","title":"Present and Potential Future Distribution of Common Vampire Bats in the Americas and the Associated Risk to Cattle","type":"Journal Article","volume":"7","issue":"8","url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0042466","tags":["2012","agriculture","Aichi_E","GBIF_used","GBIF_VIP","needs_review","South America_biodiversity","Target_19","university","US"],"keywords":[],"pages":"e42466","year":"2012","abstract":"Success of the cattle industry in Latin America is impeded by the common vampire bat, Desmodus rotundus, through decreases in milk production and mass gain and increased risk of secondary infection and rabies.

This study links pollen characters with the taxonomic divisions of the genus alder based on nrDNA ITS sequence data. The value of the study is in the breadth of the taxonomic coverage of the three subgenera, as the samples per species only range from 1 to 6. From 29 Alnus species, the authors studied pollen from 59 modern reference collections (prepared by acetolysis) and recorded the number and type of apertures (pores), thickness of the arci, pollen size and polar arci. Tallies of the number of pores on the pollen grains in a reference collection typically have a range of \u00b1 1 or 2. Exceptions are presumed hybrid collections in Alnus rugosa with a range of \u00b1 5, which have malformed pollen cells suggesting infertility. The presumed hybrids show a greater range of both pore number and size of pollen grains. The dominant pore number is a key feature that separates the subgenus Alnobetula (= Alnaster) from the other two subgenera by consistently having predominantly 5-, 6- or 7-pored pollen grains, while all other Alnus taxa sampled have pollen with predominantly 4- or 5-pored pollen. The dominant pore number is a consistent feature within the subgenus Alnobetula (10 species), but is inconsistent in 3 out of 16 species of the subgenus Alnus and within the subgenus Clethropsis (3 species). Thickenings of the pore lip, aspidate (protruding) and vestibulate pores are important features of Alnus pollen on a species level. Alnus-like pollen morphology occurs occasionally in certain other betulaceous genera (Betula and Carpinus). Differences in character or thickness of arci (band-like thickenings on the pollen wall between pores) tend to be somewhat consistent within a species and vary within subgenera. Two Alnobetula species in the Alnus viridis complex (Alnus crispa and Alnus sinuata) have arci that are weakly developed or appear as simple folds; walls are fragile and pores are typically less aspidate. Pollen sizes in different species overlap greatly, may be partly influenced by processing methods and do not seem to be generally helpful in characterizing species. Circular doughnut-shaped arci thickenings on the polar area of pollen grains are a common feature (16\u201340%) in two closely related East Asian taxa of subgenus Alnobetula with large pollen (\u2018Clade A\u2019: Alnus firma and Alnus sieboldii). These \u2018Clade A\u2019 features have been reported from Miocene collections of Alnus pollen from Alaska, and support megafossil evidence in determining the biogeography of this group along the Pacific Rim in the Neogene. The Miocene appearance of subgenus Alnobetula megafossils in both Alaska and Japan can only have occurred via a Bering Land Bridge. This relation is now confirmed by Reinink-Smith's Miocene \u2018Clade-A-type\u2019 pollen data of Alaska. These taxa had Pacific Rim distributions, similar fruiting carposamaras and now correspond to a DNA ITS subgroup within Alnobetula. Depending on the geographic location with limited number of local alder species, certain Holocene identifications are possible based on pore structure and arci thickness, e.g. the Alnus crispa-type in eastern Canada and the Alnus sinuata-type in the Pacific northwest.","uuid":"a7b18792-65b3-35ee-9462-59c408148ad4","authors":[{"forename":"Estella B.","surname":"Leopold"},{"forename":"Joshua","surname":"Birkebak"},{"forename":"Linda","surname":"Reinink-Smith"},{"forename":"Anitha P.","surname":"Jayachandar"},{"forename":"Paula","surname":"Narv\u00e1ez"},{"forename":"Stephanie","surname":"Zaborac-Reed"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Palynology","firstAuthor":"Leopold"},{"id":"6016483294","title":"Pleistocene Speciation in the Genus Populus (Salicaceae)","type":"Journal Article","volume":"online","url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22213709","tags":["2012","GBIF_used","macroecology","niche_modeling","North America_biodiversity","SDM","US"],"keywords":["glaciation","isolation-with-migration","MIMAR","North America","species distribution model"],"year":"2012","abstract":"The macro-evolutionary consequences of recent climate change remain controversial and there is little paleobotanical or morphological evidence that Pleistocene (1.8-0.12 Ma) glacial cycles acted as drivers of speciation, especially among lineages with long generation times, such as trees.

We analyzed 32 nuclear loci from individuals of P. balsamifera and P. trichocarpa to produce coalescent-based estimates of the divergence time between the two species. We coupled the coalescent analyses with paleodistribution models to assess the influence of climate change on species' range. Further, measures of niche overlap were used to investigate patterns of ecological differentiation between species. We estimated the divergence date of P. balsamifera and P. trichocarpa at approximately 75 Ka, which corresponds closely with the onset of Marine Isotope Stage 4 (\u223c 76 Ka) and a rapid increase in global ice volume. Significance tests of niche overlap, in conjunction with genetic estimates of migration, suggested that speciation occurred in allopatry, possibly resulting from the environmental effects of Pleistocene glacial cycles.

The ice recrystallization inhibition proteins (IRIP) genes, fructosyltransferase (FST) genes, and many C-repeat binding factor (CBF) genes are Pooideae specific and important in low temperature responses. Here we use comparative analyses to study conservation and evolution of these gene families in B. distachyon to better understand B. distachyon's potential as a model species for agriculturally important temperate grasses RESULTS: Brachypodium distachyon contains cold responsive IRIP genes which have evolved through Brachypodium specific gene family expansions. A large cold responsive CBF3 subfamily was identified in B. distachyon, while CBF4 homologs are absent from the genome. No B. distachyon FST gene homologs encode typical core Pooideae FST-motifs and low temperature induced fructan accumulation was dramatically different in B. distachyon compared to core Pooideae species. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that B. distachyon can serve as an interesting model for specific molecular mechanisms involved in low temperature responses in core Pooideae species. However, the evolutionary history of key genes involved in low temperature responses has been different in Brachypodium and core Pooideae species. These differences limit the use of B. distachyon as a model for holistic studies relevant for agricultural core Pooideae species.","uuid":"2b830fd2-f2f0-39e9-93cc-396482d47edd","authors":[{"forename":"Chuan","surname":"Li"},{"forename":"Heidi","surname":"Rudi"},{"forename":"Eric J.","surname":"Stockinger"},{"forename":"Hongmei","surname":"Cheng"},{"forename":"Moju","surname":"Cao"},{"forename":"Samuel E.","surname":"Fox"},{"forename":"Todd C.","surname":"Mockler"},{"forename":"Bj\u00f8rge","surname":"Westereng"},{"forename":"Siri","surname":"Fjellheim"},{"forename":"Odd Arne","surname":"Rognli"},{"forename":"Simen R.","surname":"Sandve"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Li"},{"id":"6016483804","title":"Diversification in North American arid lands: niche conservatism, divergence and expansion of habitat explain speciation in the genus Ephedra.","type":"Journal Article","volume":"65","issue":"2","url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22776548","tags":["2012","Aichi_E","GBIF_used","genetic","Mexico","museum","MX","niche_modeling","North America_biodiversity","SDM","species distribution","Target_19","US"],"keywords":["Bayes Theorem","Biological","Climate","DNA","Ecosystem","Ephedra","Ephedra: classification","Ephedra: genetics","Fossils","Genetic Speciation","Mitochondrial","Mitochondrial: genetics","Models","North America","Phylogeny","Plant","Plant: genetics","Sequence Analysis"],"pages":"437-50","year":"2012","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","abstract":"A lineage of 12 arid land shrubby species in the gymnosperm genus Ephedra (Gnetales) from North America is used to evaluate the influence of climate on speciation. With a long evolutionary history, and a well documented fossil record this lineage is an ideal model for understanding the process of speciation under a niche conservatism scenario. Using seven DNA molecular markers, Bayesian inference is carried out to uncover sister species and to estimate time of divergence of the lineages. Ecological niche models are generated for four parapatric and sympatric sister species and two analyses of niche evolution are performed, one based on ecological niche models and another using raw data and multivariate analysis. As previous analyses suggest, the diversification of North America Ephedra species may be the result of a recent secondary radiation. Both parapatric and sympatric species diverged mostly in a scenario of climatic niche conservatism. However, we also found strong evidence for niche divergence for one of the sister species pairs (E. californica-E. trifurca). Moreover, the multivariate analysis found environmental differences for some variables between sister species. The estimated divergence time of three pairs of sister species distributed in southwestern North America (E. cutleri-E. aspera, E. californica-E. trifurca and E. torreyana-E. viridis) is inferred to have occurred in the Late Miocene to Pliocene and for the sister species pair E. antisyphilitica-E. coryi distributed in the southern United States and northeastern Mexico, it was inferred from the Pliocene to Pleistocene. The orogenetic and climatic changes documented for these regions related to expansion of arid lands, may have contributed to the diversification in North American Ephedra, rather than adaptations to new climatic conditions.","uuid":"728bfad5-420a-3282-b410-8b32f7348f93","authors":[{"forename":"Israel","surname":"Loera"},{"forename":"Victoria","surname":"Sosa"},{"forename":"Stefanie M.","surname":"Ickert-Bond"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Loera"},{"id":"6016483024","title":"Investigating the evolution of Lantaneae (Verbenaceae) using multiple loci","type":"Journal Article","volume":"online","url":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/j.1095-8339.2012.01305.x","tags":["2012","Aichi_B","GBIF_used","global_distribution","invasive","plants","Target_9","US"],"keywords":["Lantana \u2013Lippia","long-distance dispersal","Neotropics","pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) loci","recent radiation"],"year":"2012","abstract":"Lantaneae are an example of a taxonomically problematic, widespread and recently radiated Neotropical lineage.

Presence-only species distribution mod- els (SDMs) represent a potential tool for assessing the biodiversity value of urban green space; however, there is limited research to validate SDM results with field surveys to see if the predictions accurately represent observed species richness. We generated a range of SDMs using multiple suitability thresh- olds for 23 species of amphibians that occur in southwest, Ohio, USA. The distributions were overlaid to enumerate species richness. We surveyed 20 sites for amphibian species to evaluate model predictions. Our models over-predicted species richness relative to survey data.

Our results suggest either SDMs built with landscape variables we selected did not represent accurately amphibian richness, or the amphibian surveys did not detect all species present.

A possibility for the lack of a relationship between PLD and range size may stem from the failure of past studies to account for the eff ect of species evolutionary ages, which may add to the dispersal capabilities of species. However, if dispersal over ecological (i.e. PLD) and across evolutionary (i.e. species evolutionary age) time scales continues to show no eff ect on range size then an outstanding question is why? Here we collected data on PLD, evolutionary ages and range sizes of seven tropical fish families (five families were reef-associated and two have dwell demersal habitats) to explore the independent and interactive effects of PLD and evolutionary age on range size. Separate analyses on each family showed that even after controlling for evolutionary age, PLD has an insignificant or a very small effect on range size. To shed light on why dispersal has such a limited effect on range size, we developed a global ocean circulation model to quantify the connectivity among tropical reefs relative to the potential dispersal conferred by PLD. We found that although there are several areas of great isolation in the tropical oceans, most reef habitats are within the reach of most species given their PLDs. These results suggest that the lack of habitat isolation can potentially render the constraining effect of dispersal on range size insignificant and explain why dispersal does not relate to range size in reef fishes.","uuid":"158bd6c8-475d-3459-bcb9-1a8b97b39603","authors":[{"forename":"Camilo","surname":"Mora"},{"forename":"Eric A.","surname":"Treml"},{"forename":"Jason","surname":"Roberts"},{"forename":"Kate","surname":"Crosby"},{"forename":"Denis","surname":"Roy"},{"forename":"Derek P.","surname":"Tittensor"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Ecography","firstAuthor":"Mora"},{"id":"6016483564","title":"Advances on molecular studies of the interaction soybean - Asian rust","type":"Journal Article","volume":"12","url":"http:\/\/www.sbmp.org.br\/cbab\/siscbab\/uploads\/c8eb9792-86b6-2ef2.pdf","tags":["2012","agriculture","Aichi_B","BR","Brazil","Brazil_biodiversity","GBIF_used","Target_7","taxonomy","university","US"],"keywords":["molecular biology","phakopsora pachyrhizi","plant-pathogen","resistance"],"pages":"1-7","year":"2012","abstract":"Effective management practices are essential for controlling rust outbreaks.

To determine the possible distribution of C. felis in three states where infection is common (Oklahoma, Missouri, and Arkansas), two separate approaches to ecological niche modeling were implemented. First, a model relating several different climatic layers to geographic locations where cases of C. felis infection were confirmed in domestic cats was developed to predict the possible distribution of the parasite. The second model incorporated occurrences of bobcats with environmental layers and land cover suitable for tick vectors to identify areas of overlap where C. felis transmission was likely.

Here we use the Himalayan Uplands Plant Database (HUP), which consists of extensive collections of botanic survey information collected by the senior author in the Himalayas and in renowned public herbaria over more than 25 years. The HUP database is primarily based on preserved herbarium specimens and presently holds more than 164,000 occurrence records of vascular plants. It contains the records of more than 2,000 collectors and observers who had either directly or indirectly contributed, or records that were derived from herbarium label information. Consistent taxonomic information and the sound use of taxonomy is the key to success of any exercise with large amounts of heterogeneous biological collection data. Taxonomy, especially on the scales of developing consistent cross-border registries, still comprises one of the most obvious bottlenecks to our understanding of biodiversity. In the absence of consistent backbone taxonomies, physical documentation (collecting, preserving, and curating of good and representative herbarium specimens or other vouchers), and quality control must be stressed as necessary preconditions to vegetation and ecology-related studies. Although inherent synonymy rates are obviously quite variable among different taxonomic groups, there is no logical, automated, or permanent procedure that could identify or constrain synonyms. A wide range of Floras, monographs, taxonomic treatments, original publications, and databases has been consulted in HUP to identify and verify specimens, and to develop, at least internally, consistent taxonomies. Other challenges of using such a large collection are the long time span covered and the diversity and inconsistency of spatial and altitudinal information. Thus, large parts of the data are currently not covered by current georeferencing databases such as BioGeomancer or by international taxonomic databases such as ITIS (Integrated Taxonomic Information System). The history of modern biodiversity exploration is brief\u2014in the Himalayas, a mere 200 years\u2014whereas dramatic ecological change and disturbance including deforestation, land degradation, melting glaciers, and increasing severity of natural hazards occurred during the periods of collection. Historic data are thus precious not only on account of the \u201cpriority principle\u201d in biological taxonomy. To ensure the highest level of usage of such precious data, we regard the availability of the data for similar and potentially even larger exercises as critically important. Here we show that a new culture needs to develop and mature for sharing, exploiting, and improving primary biodiversity data and for taxonomic work in progress. The example of HUP is used to give a step-by-step best practice guidance to make biological data digitally available online using existing and rapidly developing data-sharing infrastructures. The information of the database columns was transferred into the Darwin Core 2 format and uploaded to the publicly accessible Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF; www.gbif.org). Through GBIF it is also available using the Mountain Biodiversity Portal (MBP; www.mountain biodiversity.org), which allows to query, filter, and download GBIF data specific for mountain areas, with a horizontal (region) and vertical (elevation, climate) dimension and includes many options. In addition, a first-version XML-metadata information was created and uploaded to the National Biological Information Infrastructure (NBII) metadata clearinghouse (National Biological Information Infrastructure 2010; http:\/\/metadata.nbii.gov\/clearinghouse). Thus, the HUP data are made accessible worldwide either by searching for metadata in the NBII clearinghouse database and through the authors, by searching for original biological data at GBIF, or by searching for mountain-specific information at the Global Mountain Biodiversity Assessment (GMBA) mountain biodiversity portal.","chapter":"Chapter 6","city":"Tokyo","uuid":"e6491155-f252-31a1-bbb4-51442fe9a883","authors":[{"forename":"Dirk","surname":"Nemitz"},{"forename":"Falk","surname":"Huettmann"},{"forename":"Eva M.","surname":"Spehn"},{"forename":"Wolf Bernhard","surname":"Dickor\u00e9"}],"editors":[{"forename":"Falk","surname":"Huettmann"}],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Nemitz"},{"id":"6016482204","title":"Phylogeny and biogeography in Solanaceae, Verbenaceae and Bignoniaceae: a comparison of continental and intercontinental diversification patterns","type":"Journal Article","volume":"online","url":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/j.1095-8339.2012.01306.x","tags":["2012","Aichi_E","GBIF_used","plants","South America_biodiversity","Target_19","US"],"keywords":["biogeography","long-distance dispersal","Neotropics","South America"],"year":"2012","abstract":"Recent molecular phylogenetic studies of Solanales and Lamiales show that Solanaceae, Verbenaceae and Bignoniaceae all diversified in South America.

Here, we combine information from nuclear microsatellite markers and ecological niche modelling to study the association between climate and spatial genetic structure and variability in Engelmann oak (Quercus engelmannii), a wind-pollinated species with high potential for gene flow. We first test whether genetic diversity is associated with climatic niche suitability and stability since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Second, we use causal modelling to analyse the potential influence of climatic factors (current and LGM niche suitability) and altitude in the observed patterns of genetic structure. We found that genetic diversity is negatively associated with local climatic stability since the LGM, which may be due to higher immigration rates in unstable patches during favourable climatic periods and\/or temporally varying selection. Analyses of spatial genetic structure revealed the presence of three main genetic clusters, a pattern that is mainly driven by two highly differentiated populations located in the northern edge of the species distribution range. After controlling for geographic distance, causal modelling analyses showed that genetic relatedness decreases with the environmental divergence among sampling sites estimated as altitude and current and LGM niche suitability. Natural selection against nonlocal genotypes and\/or asynchrony in reproductive phenology may explain this pattern. Overall, this study suggests that local environmental conditions can shape patterns of genetic structure and variability even in species with high potential for gene flow and relatively small distribution ranges.","uuid":"128e7d7b-f99d-3bab-8e6c-58d7c2afd95f","authors":[{"forename":"Joaqu\u00edn","surname":"Ortego"},{"forename":"Erin C.","surname":"Riordan"},{"forename":"Paul Francis","surname":"Gugger"},{"forename":"Victoria L.","surname":"Sork"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Ortego"},{"id":"6016482314","title":"Global patterns of leaf defenses in oak species","type":"Journal Article","volume":"66","issue":"7","url":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/j.1558-5646.2012.01591.x\nhttp:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22759301","tags":["2012","conservation","GBIF_used","Global_biodiversity","museum","university","US"],"keywords":["Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism Analysis","Animals","Biological Evolution","Climate","Ecosystem","Environment","Food Chain","Genetic","Herbivory","Models","Phylogeny","Physiological","Plant Leaves","Plant Leaves: genetics","Plant Leaves: physiology","Quercus","Quercus: genetics","Quercus: physiology","Seasons","Stress"],"pages":"2272-86","year":"2012","abstract":"Plant defensive traits drive patterns of herbivory and herbivore diversity among plant species.

Climate predicted both the chemical leaf defenses and the physical leaf defenses of oaks, whether analyzed separately or in combination. Oak leaf defenses were higher at lower latitudes, and this latitudinal gradient could be explained entirely by climate. Using phylogenetic regression methods, we found that plant defenses tended to be greater in oak species that occur in regions with low temperature seasonality, mild winters, and low minimum precipitation, and that plant defenses may track the abiotic environment slowly over macroevolutionary time. The pattern of association we observed between oak leaf traits and abiotic environments was consistent with a combination of a seasonality gradient, which may relate to different herbivore pressures, and the resource availability hypothesis, which posits that herbivores exert greater selection on plants in resource-limited abiotic environments.","uuid":"fc6d6d83-73ea-3785-8fdd-5def951efcda","authors":[{"forename":"Ian S.","surname":"Pearse"},{"forename":"Andrew L.","surname":"Hipp"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Evolution","firstAuthor":"Pearse"},{"id":"6016482104","title":"Evidence of a climatic niche shift following North American introductions of two crane flies (Diptera; genus Tipula)","type":"Journal Article","volume":"online","url":"http:\/\/www.springerlink.com\/index\/10.1007\/s10530-012-0337-3","tags":["2012","Aichi_B","GBIF_used","global_biodiversity","invasive","in_press","Target_9","university","US"],"notes":"Does an invasive species shift niches or do they practice niche conservatism? <m:linebreak><\/m:linebreak>\n        <m:linebreak><\/m:linebreak>Spatial extent should be evaluated when studying niche conservatism","keywords":["Ecological Niche Modeling","invasion biology","Maxent","Tipula oleracea","Tipula paludosa","Tipuloidea"],"year":"2012","abstract":"Ecological niche models assume a species niche should be conserved over space and time. Increasingly, studies have determined that niche shifts may occur during biological invasion events. The aim of this study is to examine niche conservation for two invasive crane flies, Tipula oleracea Linnaeus and Tipula paludosa Meigen, after introductions into North America. These species have broadly sympatric invasive distributions but differ in time since introduction and dispersal abilities. As these factors may impact the area accessible to dispersal, I examined the impact of background area delineation on conclusions of niche conservation. Results indicated that alternative delineations of accessible area (i.e., background area) had no affect on measures of niche equivalence. Neither Tipula species was found to be occupying invasive niche space equivalent to that of their native ranges. Niche dissimilarity was found for both species, with results strongly impacted by the choice of background area. T. paludosa introductions displayed a niche shift across both invasive introductions when the model area drew climatic information from an area that buffered occurrences by 40 km. The eastern T. oleracea introduction displayed a niche shift when background information was drawn from within a 400 km buffered area. This study suggests that invasive populations may be displaying a niche shift when evaluated against one scale of background but conserved when evaluated against another scale. Dispersal limitations for T. oleracea in its eastern introduction and anthropogenic habitat associations for T. paludosa across both invasive introductions are indicated as causes for the observed niche shifts. The results of this study highlight the importance of carefully delineating the area accessible to invasive species in studies of niche conservation. Furthermore, it indicates that examining several spatial extents of background areas can be beneficial when examining niche conservation for species in non-equilibrium states.","uuid":"217a74c7-edcf-30bc-b234-4009af6c4fdf","authors":[{"forename":"Matthew J.","surname":"Petersen"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Biological Invasions","firstAuthor":"Petersen"},{"id":"6016484324","title":"Predicted range shifts in North American boreal forest birds and the effect of climate change on genetic diversity in blackpoll warblers (Setophaga striata)","type":"Journal Article","volume":"online","url":"http:\/\/www.springerlink.com\/index\/10.1007\/s10592-012-0418-y","tags":["2012","Aichi_E","birds","climate","GBIF_used","in_press","North America_biodiversity","Target_19","US"],"notes":"debate on if this is target 10 or 19","keywords":["boreal forest birds","climate change","conservation genetics","microsatellites","Setophaga striata","species distribution models"],"year":"2012","abstract":"As North American species\u2019 ranges shift northward in response to climate change, populations isolated in high-elevation habitat \u201cislands\u201d at the southern edge of distributions are predicted to decrease in size or be extirpated. Levels of genetic structure and gene flow and the number of private alleles held within these peripheral populations can be used as a measure of the potential loss of genetic diversity due to climate change. We use GIS-based climate niche models to project geographic distributions of 15 boreal forest bird species for the year 2080 under two carbon emissions scenarios to predict the extent to which ranges will shift, leading to the extirpation of isolated populations at the southern periphery of the boreal forest. Breeding distributions of nearly all boreal bird species are predicted to expand as they shift northward, but will dramatically decrease or be completely lost from mountain populations in New York, Vermont, and New Hampshire by 2080. To examine the effect of these shifts on gene pools of migratory bird species we genotyped 178 blackpoll warblers (Setophaga striata) at nine microsatellite loci, sampling four imperiled high-elevation populations and four northern populations. In S. striata 10.4 % of microsatellite alleles were confined to populations expected to be lost due to climate change. However, these accounted for a nonsignificant percent of the genetic structure, and loss of these alleles would not significantly erode species heterozygosity or allelic richness. Our results indicate that isolated southern populations of S. striata, and possibly other migratory species with high gene flow, do not represent genetically isolated, independently evolving units. Efforts to mitigate the effect of climate change on boreal forest birds should focus on species in which peripheral populations harbor significant genetic diversity.","uuid":"81e6bbb2-8ca0-3419-b06d-90443cb8688d","authors":[{"forename":"Joel","surname":"Ralston"},{"forename":"Jeremy J.","surname":"Kirchman"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Conservation Genetics","firstAuthor":"Ralston"},{"id":"6016484374","title":"Analysis of threats to South American flora and its implications for conservation","type":"Journal Article","url":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S1617138112000830","tags":["2012","Aichi_C","CO","Colombia","GB","GBIF_acknowledged","GBIF_funded","GBIF_used","GBIF_VIP","South America_biodiversity","Target_12","US"],"keywords":["Agriculture","Anthropogenic activities","Diversity","Extinction","Populations","Protected areas","Species richness"],"year":"2012","publisher":"Elsevier GmbH.","abstract":"South America houses a significant proportion of the world\u2019s plant diversity and therefore merits con- servation attention.

Location: Twenty-five countries in Central and South America, and the West Indies. Methods: Chloroplast simple sequence repeats (cpSSR; eight loci) were assayed in 67 populations (240 individuals) sampled from the full geographic range of C. alliodora. Chloroplast (trnH\u2013psbA) and nuclear (internal transcribed spacer, ITS) DNA sequences were sampled from a geographically representative subset. Genetic structure was determined with samova, structure and haplotype networks. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) and rarefaction analyses were used to compare regional haplotype diversity and differentiation. Results Although the ITS region was polymorphic it revealed limited phylogeographic structure, and trnH\u2013psbA was monomorphic. However, structure analysis of cpSSR variation recovered three broad demes spanning Central America (Deme 1), the Greater Antilles and the Choc\u00f3 (Deme 2), and the Lesser Antilles and cis-Andean South America (Deme 3). samova showed two predominant demes (Deme 1 + 2 and Deme 3). The greatest haplotype diversity was detected east of the Andes, while significantly more genetic variation was partitioned among trans-Andean populations. Populations experiencing high precipitation seasonality (dry ecotype) had greater levels of genetic variation. Main conclusions Cordia alliodora displayed weak cis- and trans-Andean phylogeographic structure based on DNA sequence data, indicative of historical dispersal around this barrier and genetic exchange across its broad range. The cpSSR data revealed phylogeographic structure corresponding to three biogeographic zones. Patterns of genetic diversity are indicative of an origin in the seasonally dry habitats of South America. Therefore, C. alliodora fits the disperser hypothesis for widespread Neotropical species. Dispersal is evident in the West Indies and the northern Andean cordilleras. The dry ecotype harbours genetic variation that is likely to represent the source for the establishment of populations under future warmer and drier climatic scenarios.","uuid":"b6f163af-a513-3bc1-acfb-e8fc76d5e1b7","authors":[{"forename":"Paul D.","surname":"Rymer"},{"forename":"Christopher W.","surname":"Dick"},{"forename":"Giovanni G.","surname":"Vendramin"},{"forename":"Anna","surname":"Buonamici"},{"forename":"David","surname":"Boshier"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Journal of Biogeography","firstAuthor":"Rymer"},{"id":"6016481564","title":"A GIS framework for the refinement of species geographic ranges","type":"Journal Article","volume":"26","issue":"1","url":"http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/13658816.2011.567987","tags":["2012","Aichi_E","conservation","distribution","GBIF_used","South America_biodiversity","Target_19","university","US"],"keywords":[],"pages":"39-55","year":"2012","abstract":"The archives of species range polygons developed under comprehensive assessments of the conservation status of species, such as the IUCN's Global Assessments, are a significant resource in the analysis of biodiversity for conservation planning.

In this work, we present a method to refine those species range polygons in order to create more realistic representations of species geographic ranges. Using range polygons of four species of mammals in South America and environmental variables at a 1 km resolution, combined with a set of GIS algorithms, a procedure was developed to map the confidence that sub-polygon elements belong to a logical species range.

Methods for variable selection and quality assessment of the refined range are also included in the procedure. Analysis using independent validation data shows the power of this methodology to redefine species ranges in a more biophysically reasonable way.

Multiple independent shifts between tropical and temperate forest habitats have repeatedly been accompanied by a change between evergreen, elliptical leaves with entire margins and deciduous, more rounded leaves with toothed or lobed margins.

The basis of interspecific variation in maximum stomatal conductance to water (g(max) ), as defined by stomatal density and size, was investigated in a common-environment screening experiment. Stomatal traits were measured in 28 species from seven grass lineages, and comparative methods were used to test for predicted effects of C(3) and C(4) photosynthesis, annual precipitation and habitat wetness on g(max) . Novel results were as follows: significant phylogenetic patterns exist in g(max) and its determinants, stomatal size and stomatal density; C(4) species consistently have lower g(max) than their C(3) relatives, associated with a shift towards smaller stomata at a given density. A direct relationship between g(max) and precipitation was not supported. However, we confirmed associations between C(4) photosynthesis and lower precipitation, and showed steeper stomatal size-density relationships and higher g(max) in wetter habitats. The observed relationships between stomatal patterning, photosynthetic pathway and habitat provide a clear example of the interplay between anatomical traits, physiological innovation and ecological adaptation in plants.","uuid":"f3e1e9ce-5c94-3d04-8ee8-1acba0c17d59","authors":[{"forename":"S.

Their progress is measured in code-compliant species descriptions that include text, images, type material and molecular sequences. It is from this material that other researchers are to identify individuals of the same species in future observations. It has been estimated that 13% to 22% (depending on taxonomic group) of described species have only ever been observed once. Species that have only been observed at the time and place of their original description are referred to as oncers. Oncers are important to our current understanding of biodiversity. They may be validly described species that are members of a rare biosphere, or they may indicate endemism, or that these species are limited to very constrained niches. Alternatively, they may reflect that taxonomic practices are too poor to allow the organism to be re-identified or that the descriptions are unknown to other researchers. If the latter are true, our current tally of species will not be an accurate indication of what we know. In order to investigate this phenomenon and its potential causes, we examined the microbial eukaryote genus Gymnodinium. This genus contains 268 extant species, 103 (38%) of which have not been observed since their original description. We report traits of the original descriptions and interpret them in respect to the status of the species. We conclude that the majority of oncers were poorly described and their identity is ambiguous. As a result, we argue that the genus Gymnodinium contains only 234 identifiable species. Species that have been observed multiple times tend to have longer descriptions, written in English. The styles of individual authors have a major effect, with a few authors describing a disproportionate number of oncers.

Although these features dis- tinguish most individuals, the occurrence of morphologically intermediate specimens within broadly overlapping geographic ranges often confounds their identification. Hybridization of these taxa has not been documented previously, yet the potential exists for gene flow between N. aquatica and N. cordata because of their similar floral morphology, reliance on outcrossing, and partial sympatry. We studied indi- viduals collected across the ranges of N. aquatica and N. cordata, using morphological data and nuclear (ITS) and chloroplast (matK\/trnK) molecular sequence data, to better ascertain their distinctness and to investigate further the possibility of hybridization. Quantitative morphological data supported the exis- tence of two species that are broadly diagnosable across several measurements, although approximately seven percent of specimens analyzed remained undiagnosed under our criteria. Molecular phylogenetic results indicated that most individuals of N. aquatica and N. cordata were readily identifiable to one or the other species, and these corresponded to reciprocally monophyletic groups. However, molecular cloning revealed that some individuals collected within the sympatric range of N. aquatica and N. cordata were interspecific hybrids, and these individuals on average were morphologically intermediate between the two parental species. These data are consistent with a taxonomic concept that accepts two fundamentally distinct Nymphoides species, nevertheless with some individuals being morphologically intermediate, at least partly as a result of natural interspecific hybridization. \u00a9","uuid":"5c5fc700-c1b1-3579-9312-d8f2a0baf2d3","authors":[{"forename":"Nicholas P.","surname":"Tippery"},{"forename":"Donald H.","surname":"Les"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Aquatic Botany","firstAuthor":"Tippery"},{"id":"6016483604","title":"Species distribution modelling as a macroecological tool: a case study using New World amphibians","type":"Journal Article","volume":"35","issue":"6","url":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/j.1600-0587.2011.07050.x","tags":["2012","Aichi_E","amphibians","climate","conservation","ES","GBIF_used","GBIF_VIP","niche_modeling","North America_biodiversity","SDM","South America_biodiversity","Spain","Target_19","university","US"],"keywords":[],"pages":"539-548","year":"2012","abstract":"Although species distribution modelling (SDM) is widely accepted among the scientific community and is increasingly used in ecology, conservation biology and biogeography, methodological limitations generate potential problems for its application in macroecology.

Methods We develop a novel application of species distribution models for intertidal taxa by using both oceanographic and terrestrial environmental variables recently made available at biologically relevant pixel resolutions. We use these model-based distribution estimates to test alternative hypotheses of late Pleistocene history across six amphi-Atlantic taxa whose hypothesized Pleistocene distributions are constructed from previous population genetic inferences. Results Species distribution models correctly estimate all six current amphi-Atlantic distributions on both sides of the Atlantic. Models hindcasted to the Last Glacial Maximum estimate trans-Atlantic distributional persistence in three of six taxa, and conversely indicate no suitable habitat on the North American coastline in the other three taxa. These results are consistent with the histories inferred from population genetic data for five of six of the taxa, the exception being Nucella lapillus, whose hindcasted trans-Atlantic persistence at the Last Glacial Maximum contrasts with the mitochondrial DNA-based estimates of post-glacial expansion from Europe to North America. Main conclusions Marine and terrestrial distribution models are broadly concordant with known contemporary distributions and fail to reject five of six historical distributional hypotheses based on population genetic inferences. This demonstrated utility suggests that this technique could be expanded to examine how Pleistocene and contemporary climate change might play a role in intertidal species distributions across the entire community. Future application and development of these marine and terrestrial distribution models will strengthen inferences regarding the processes generating intertidal community assembly and population divergence, and may assist in conservation planning and the design of marine reserves.","uuid":"66aa8274-6a43-30b1-a05e-d1f713384a61","authors":[{"forename":"Eric","surname":"Waltari"},{"forename":"Michael J.","surname":"Hickerson"}],"editors":[{"forename":"Craig","surname":"McClain"}],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Waltari"},{"id":"6016483504","title":"Do bioclimate variables improve performance of climate envelope models?","type":"Journal Article","volume":"246","url":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0304380012003468","tags":["2012","Aichi_E","climate","GBIF_used","GBIF_VIP","National Park Service","needs_review","niche_modeling","SDM","species distribution","Target_19","university","US","US Fish and Wildlife Service","USA_biodiversity","USGS"],"keywords":["climate envelope model","Endangered species","Species distribution model"],"pages":"79-85","year":"2012","abstract":"Climate envelope models are widely used to forecast potential effects of climate change on species distributions.

High values of Picea pollen and the presence of Larix pollen in sediments dated to 50\u201340 ka BP strongly suggest the presence of forest or woodland early in MIS 3; the trees grew within a vegetation matrix dominated by grass and sedge, and there is indirect evidence of grazing animals.

An early Holocene warm period is indicated by renewed thermokarst lake formation and a range of fossil taxa. Multiple extralimital plant taxa suggest mean July temperatures above modern values.

Theory predicts that ectotherms should respond to increased thermal variability by lowering the thermal sensitivity of metabolism, which will reduce the impact of the warm portion of thermal variability. We examined the thermal sensitivity of metabolic rate of overwintering Erynnis propertius (Lepidoptera: Hesperiidae) larvae from a stable or variable environment reared in the laboratory in a reciprocal common garden design, and used these data to model energy use during the winters of 1973\u20132010 using meteorological data to predict the energetic outcomes of metabolic compensation and phenological shifts. Larvae that experienced variable temperatures had decreased thermal sensitivity of metabolic rate, and were larger than those reared at stable temperatures, which could partially compensate for the increased energetic demands. Even with depressed thermal sensitivity, the variable environment was more energy-demanding than the stable, with the majority of this demand occurring in autumn. Autumn phenology changes thus had disproportionate influence on energy consumption in variable environments, and variable-reared larvae were most susceptible to overwinter energy drain. Therefore the energetic impacts of the timing of entry into winter dormancy will strongly influence ectotherm fitness in northern temperate environments. We conclude that thermal variability drives the expression of metabolic suppression in this species; that phenological shifts will have a greater impact on ectotherms in variable thermal environments; and that E. propertius will be more sensitive to shifts in phenology in autumn than in spring. This suggests that increases in overwinter thermal variability and\/or extended, warm autumns, will negatively impact all non-feeding dormant ectotherms which lack the ability to suppress their overwinter metabolic thermal sensitivity.","uuid":"7db1a150-9220-31cb-916d-c6edba5b67fe","authors":[{"forename":"Caroline M.","surname":"Williams"},{"forename":"Katie E.","surname":"Marshall"},{"forename":"Heath A.","surname":"MacMillan"},{"forename":"Jason D.

Understanding species' abilities to shift ranges has important implications for assessing extinction risk and predicting future community structure. At an expanding front, colonization rates are determined jointly by rates of reproduction and dispersal. In addition, establishment of viable populations requires that individuals find suitable resources in novel habitats. Thus, species with greater dispersal ability, reproductive rate and ecological generalization should be more likely to expand into new regions under climate change. Here, we assess current evidence for the relationship between leading-edge range shifts and species' traits. We found expected relationships for several datasets, including diet breadth in North American Passeriformes and egg-laying habitat in British Odonata. However, models generally had low explanatory power. Thus, even statistically and biologically meaningful relationships are unlikely to be of predictive utility for conservation and management. Trait-based range shift forecasts face several challenges, including quantifying relevant natural history variation across large numbers of species and coupling these data with extrinsic factors such as habitat fragmentation and availability.","uuid":"a605a495-5a76-3844-a1db-bdbf0a3bd4ed","authors":[{"forename":"Amy L.","surname":"Angert"},{"forename":"Lisa G.","surname":"Crozier"},{"forename":"Leslie","surname":"Rissler"},{"forename":"Sarah E.","surname":"Gilman"},{"forename":"Josh J.","surname":"Tewksbury"},{"forename":"Amanda J.","surname":"Chunco"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Angert"},{"id":"6016480254","title":"Spore-Bearing Vascular Plants: Identification Keys For Use In The Intermountain Region Of Western North America","type":"Working Paper","url":"http:\/\/herbarium.usu.edu\/IMRkeys\/SporebearingIMR2.pdf","tags":["2011","distribution","GBIF_used","taxonomy","university","US"],"keywords":[],"pages":"1-36","year":"2011","abstract":"This treatment is a derivative work.

As potential bioenergy crops are being moved around the world an assessment of the climatic suitability would be a prudent first step in identifying suitable areas of productivity and risk. Additionally, this assessment also provides a necessary step in evaluating the invasive potential of bioenergy crops, which present a possible negative externality to the bioeconomy. Therefore, we provide the first global climate niche assessment for the major graminaceous (9), herbaceous (3), and woody (4) bioenergy crops. Additionally, we contrast these with climate niche assessments for North American invasive species that were originally introduced for agronomic purposes as examples of well-intentioned introductions gone awry. With few exceptions (e.g., Saccharum officinarum, Pennisetum purpureum), the bioenergy crops exhibit broad climatic tolerance, which allows tremendous flexibility in choosing crops, especially in areas with high summer rainfall and long growing seasons (e.g., southeastern US, Amazon Basin, eastern Australia). Unsurprisingly, the invasive species of agronomic origin have very similar global climate niche profiles as the proposed bioenergy crops, also demonstrating broad climatic tolerance. The ecoregional evaluation of bioenergy crops and known invasive species demonstrates tremendous overlap at both high (EI\u226530) and moderate (EI\u226520) climate suitability. The southern and western US ecoregions support the greatest number of invasive species of agronomic origin, especially the Southeastern USA Plains, Mixed Woods Plains, and Mediterranean California. Many regions of the world have a suitable climate for several bioenergy crops allowing selection of agro-ecoregionally appropriate crops. This model knowingly ignores the complex biotic interactions and edaphic conditions, but provides a robust assessment of the climate niche, which is valuable for agronomists, crop developers, and regulators seeking to choose agro-ecoregionally appropriate crops while minimizing the risk of invasive species.","uuid":"970f6b7c-31e6-3ad6-83f3-5bbfe9eee2b9","authors":[{"forename":"Jacob N.","surname":"Barney"},{"forename":"Joseph M.","surname":"DiTomaso"}],"editors":[{"forename":"Dorian","surname":"Fuller"}],"publication_outlet":"PloS one","firstAuthor":"Barney"},{"id":"6016479884","title":"Using Expert Knowledge to Satisfy Data Needs: Mapping Invasive Plant Distributions in the Western United States","type":"Journal Article","volume":"71","issue":"3","url":"http:\/\/www.bioone.org\/doi\/abs\/10.3398\/064.071.0314","tags":["2011","Aichi_B","GBIF_used","invasive","Target_9","university","US","USA_biodiversity"],"keywords":[],"pages":"302-315","year":"2011","abstract":"ABSTRACT.\u2014Lack of knowledge about the distributions of plant and animal species can severely hamper management efforts. For invasive plants, distribution and abundance data can inform early detection and rapid response (EDRR) programs aimed at treating initial infestations. These data can be used to create invasion risk models at landscape and regional scales. Further, regional maps of invasive plant abundance are useful for communicating the scope of the invasive species problem to the public and policymakers. Here, we present a set of regional distribution maps for 10 problematic invasive plants in the western United States, created from the expert knowledge of weed managers in over 300 counties. Invasive plant experts identified infestations on paper, and the results were digitized into a regional GIS. Over 40% of requests were returned, resulting in maps with good spatial coverage and distribution data suitable for assessing invasive plant abundance across the western United States. Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) and Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense) were the most abundant and widespread of the surveyed species; however, the high concentrations and broad spatial extents of other invasive plants, such as hounds tongue (Cynoglossum officinale), white top (Lepidium draba), and Dalmatian toadflax (Linaria dalmatica), highlight the ongoing problems invasive species pose for western ecosystems, rangelands, and croplands. These results reinforce the critical role that regional mapping efforts can play in assessing and communicating invasion risk. This study suggests that knowledge about plant invasions exists locally and that experts are willing to participate in regional efforts to compile that information.","uuid":"bd2458c1-35cf-32bf-b616-ed7bc644746a","authors":[{"forename":"Bethany A.","surname":"Bradley"},{"forename":"David C.","surname":"Marvin"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Western North American Naturalist","firstAuthor":"Bradley"},{"id":"6016479414","title":"Integrating statistical genetic and geospatial methods brings new power to phylogeography","type":"Journal Article","volume":"59","issue":"2","url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21352934","tags":["2011","GBIF_used","niche_modeling","phylogeography","SDM","university","US"],"keywords":["Biogeography","Coalescence","Divergence","Gene flow","Geographic Information Systems","Population genetics","Spatially explicit","Statistical phylogeography"],"pages":"523-37","year":"2011","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","abstract":"The field of phylogeography continues to grow in terms of power and accessibility.

Yet the potential consequences of climate-induced plant species losses for the functioning of these ecosystems are poorly understood. We investigated how climate change might alter the functional composition of grasslands for Konza Prairie, a diverse tallgrass prairie in central North America. With species-specific climate envelopes, we show that a reduction in mean annual precipitation would preferentially remove species that are more abundant in the more productive lowland positions at Konza. As such, decreases in precipitation could reduce productivity not only by reducing water availability but by also removing species that inhabit the most productive areas and respond the most to climate variability. In support of this prediction, data on species abundance at Konza over 16 years show that species that are more abundant in lowlands than uplands are preferentially reduced in years with low precipitation. Climate change is likely to also preferentially remove species from particular functional groups and clades. For example, warming is forecast to preferentially remove perennials over annuals as well as Cyperaceae species. Despite these predictions, climate change is unlikely to unilaterally alter the functional composition of the tallgrass prairie flora, as many functional traits such as physiological drought tolerance and maximum photosynthetic rates showed little relationship with climate envelope parameters. In all, although climatic drying would indirectly alter grassland productivity through species loss patterns, the insurance afforded by biodiversity to ecosystem function is likely to be sustained in the face of climate change.","uuid":"a951b1f7-8016-3ec3-9153-259094af9dd3","authors":[{"forename":"Joseph M.","surname":"Craine"},{"forename":"Jesse B.","surname":"Nippert"},{"forename":"E.

Despite the centrality of species distributions to biodiversity conservation, the demonstrated large migration of tropical plant species in response to climate change in the past, and the expected sensitivity of species distributions to modern climate change, no study has tested for modern species migrations in tropical plants. Here we conduct a first test of the hypothesis that increasing temperatures are causing tropical trees to migrate to cooler areas. Location Tropical Andes biodiversity hotspot, south-eastern Peru, South America. Methods We use data from repeated (2003\/04\u20132007\/08) censuses of 14 1-ha forest inventory plots spanning an elevational gradient from 950 to 3400 m in Manu National Park in south-eastern Peru, to characterize changes in the elevational distributions of 38 Andean tree genera. We also analyse changes in the genus-level composition of the inventory plots through time. Results We show that most tropical Andean tree genera shifted their mean distributions upslope over the study period and that the mean rate of migration is approximately 2.5\u20133.5 vertical metres upslope per year. Consistent with upward migrations we also find increasing abundances of tree genera previously distributed at lower elevations in the majority of study plots. Main conclusions These findings are in accord with the a priori hypothesis of upward shifts in species ranges due to elevated temperatures, and are potentially the first documented evidence of present-day climate-driven migrations in a tropical plant community. The observed mean rate of change is less than predicted from the temperature increases for the region, possibly due to the influence of changes in moisture or non-climatic factors such as substrate, species interactions, lags in tree community response and\/or dispersal limitations. Whatever the cause(s), continued slower-than-expected migration of tropical Andean trees would indicate a limited ability to respond to increased temperatures, which may lead to increased extinction risks with further climate change.","uuid":"60d1493f-ac45-3b46-85e3-4e47f4fac452","authors":[{"forename":"Kenneth J.","surname":"Feeley"},{"forename":"Miles R.","surname":"Silman"},{"forename":"Mark B.","surname":"Bush"},{"forename":"William","surname":"Farfan"},{"forename":"Karina Garcia","surname":"Cabrera"},{"forename":"Yadvinder","surname":"Malhi"},{"forename":"Patrick","surname":"Meir"},{"forename":"Norma Salinas","surname":"Revilla"},{"forename":"Mireya Natividad Raurau","surname":"Quisiyupanqui"},{"forename":"Sassan","surname":"Saatchi"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Journal of Biogeography","firstAuthor":"Feeley"},{"id":"6016479954","title":"Keep collecting: accurate species distribution modelling requires more collections than previously thought","type":"Journal Article","volume":"17","issue":"6","url":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/j.1472-4642.2011.00813.x","tags":["2011","Amazon","Andes","conservation","ecology","GBIF_used","niche_modeling","SDM","university","US"],"keywords":["amazon","andes","collecting biases","conservation biogeography","maxent","range"],"pages":"1132-1140","year":"2011","abstract":"Aim Species distribution models (SDMs) use the locations of collection records to map the distributions of species, making them a powerful tool in conservation biology, ecology and biogeography.

One potential source of error for modeling widespread species is that subspecies and\/or races of species are frequently pooled for analyses, which may mask biologically relevant spatial variation within the distribution of a single widespread species. We contrast a presence-only maximum entropy model for the widely distributed oldfield mouse (Peromyscus polionotus) that includes all available presence locations for this species, with two composite maximum entropy models. The composite models either subdivided the total species distribution into four geographic quadrants or by fifteen subspecies to capture spatially relevant variation in P. polionotus distributions. Results Despite high Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) values for all models, the composite species distribution model of P. polionotus generated from individual subspecies models represented the known distribution of the species much better than did the models produced by partitioning data into geographic quadrants or modeling the whole species as a single unit. Conclusions Because the AUC values failed to describe the differences in the predictability of the three modeling strategies, we suggest using omission curves in addition to AUC values to assess model performance. Dividing the data of a widespread species into biologically relevant partitions greatly increased the performance of our distribution model; therefore, this approach may prove to be quite practical and informative for a wide range of modeling applications.","uuid":"aed925a7-9087-3f22-9657-2c320bacd622","authors":[{"forename":"Sergio C.","surname":"Gonzalez"},{"forename":"J.

Based on morphological evidence, previous authors have hypothesized a Florida origin from either Q. geminata or Q. virginiana or both; a Mexican origin from Q. oleoides; or a hybrid origin from both sources. We use molecular data and taxonomically informative leaf morphology to identify the source species and timing of colonization. Location Cuba, Central America, Mexico and the south-eastern United States. Methods We collected representative samples of Cuban oaks and each putative source species and genotyped each sample at 12 nuclear microsatellites and two chloroplast DNA sequences. We estimated population structure using a Bayesian clustering analysis and F-statistics, pairwise migration rates among taxa, and divergence time using an isolation-with-migration model. We measured seven leaf traits and conducted an analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) to determine which putative source species was most similar to Cuban oaks. Results Cuban oak contains one chloroplast DNA haplotype, which is common in southern Florida. Bayesian clustering analysis of microsatellites revealed that the Cuban oak forms a distinct and pure population cluster, and F-statistics showed that Cuban oaks are differentiated least from Q. virginiana and most from Q. geminata. Migration rates were highest out of Cuba to Q. oleoides. Molecular diversity, the ratio of allelic richness to allele size range, and effective population size of the Cuban oak were relatively low, suggesting a founder effect. Divergence time estimates fell entirely within the Pleistocene (628\u20136 ka), considering a range of mutation rates and generation times. Cuban oaks were morphologically most similar to Q. virginiana and least similar to Q. geminata. Main conclusions Molecular and morphological data support a Pleistocene dispersal of Q. virginiana from Florida to Cuba, followed by isolation and divergence, then limited dispersal and introgression from Cuba to Q. oleoides in Central America. Birds could have dispersed acorns to Cuba during a glacial period when sea levels were low. These results highlight the varied origin of the Cuban biota and the possible role of Pleistocene glaciations in the establishment of temperate taxa in the tropics.","uuid":"68e75324-87c7-3d06-8748-e3493e5d4359","authors":[{"forename":"Paul Francis","surname":"Gugger"},{"forename":"Jeannine","surname":"Cavender-Bares"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Gugger"},{"id":"6016479784","title":"Potential ecological impacts of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) biofuel cultivation in the Central Great Plains, USA","type":"Journal Article","volume":"35","issue":"8","url":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0961953411002935","tags":["2011","agriculture","Aichi_B","GBIF_used","invasive","Target_9","US"],"keywords":["Carbon sequestration","Crop rotation","CRP land","Landscape heterogeneity","Marginal land","SOC"],"pages":"3415-3421","year":"2011","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","abstract":"Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is a broadly adapted warm-season grass species native to most of the central and eastern United States.

Because of strong homoplasy of leaf characters, the fossils could not be placed more specifically within recognized clades, and additional data were needed to specify intrafamilial and paleogeographic relationships during the Paleocene. \u2022 Methods: Fossil endocarps of Menispermaceae were collected from the Cerrej\u00f3n Formation, the recently discovered Bogot\u00e1 flora, and Wyoming (\u223c60 Ma). We surveyed the endocarp morphology of almost all extant genera, conducted character optimization, a molecular scaffold analysis, and critically reviewed the related fossil genera. \u2022 Key results: Parallel syndromes of fruit characters have appeared in unrelated clades of the family according to current phylogenetic reconstructions. However, mapping selected endocarp characters across those clades that contain horseshoe-shaped endocarps facilitates identification and phylogenetic assessment of the fossils. Three fossil species are recognized. One of them belongs to the extant genus Stephania, which today grows only in Africa and Australasia.

In order to anticipate threats and prioritize management actions for H. hampei we present here, maps on future distributions of H. hampei in coffee producing areas of East Africa. Using the CLIMEX model we relate present-day insect distributions to current climate and then project the fitted climatic envelopes under future scenarios A2A and B2B (for HADCM3 model). In both scenarios, the situation with H. hampei is forecasted to worsen in the current Coffea arabica producing areas of Ethiopia, the Ugandan part of the Lake Victoria and Mt. Elgon regions, Mt. Kenya and the Kenyan side of Mt. Elgon, and most of Rwanda and Burundi. The calculated hypothetical number of generations per year of H. hampei is predicted to increase in all C. arabica-producing areas from five to ten.

Here, we investigated this hypothesis, presenting 20 months of data on fecal progestin (fP) patterns in wild female Phayre's leaf monkeys (Trachypithecus phayrei crepusculus). We examined whether (a) the availability of Vitex (a plant known to contain phytochemicals) might be linked to seasonal fP levels, (b) fP levels were associated with female reproductive performance, and (c) reproductive performance might also be linked with energetic status (as measured by physical condition). We collected fecal samples (N=2077) from 10 adult females to analyze estrogen (fE) and progestin (fP) metabolites, behavioral data from 7 cycling females to determine receptivity, and monthly data on Vitex availability and female physical condition. Seasonally elevated fP levels were found in all females, with higher levels when Vitex leaves and fruits were abundant. During the period of high progestins, females had longer cycle lengths and follicular phases, while receptive periods did not change. Nevertheless, when ovulations occurred, females were more likely to conceive. On the other hand, conceptions were also more likely when physical condition was improving, suggesting that the effects of phytochemicals and energetic status on reproduction may be difficult to separate. Although our results support the predicted effects of Vitex on endocrine and reproductive function, future studies with detailed feeding data and chemical analyses of plants are needed to confirm this finding.","uuid":"4b257706-fe6a-37e1-b98d-727e774fccce","authors":[{"forename":"Amy","surname":"Lu"},{"forename":"Jacinta C.","surname":"Beehner"},{"forename":"Nancy M.","surname":"Czekala"},{"forename":"Andreas","surname":"Koenig"},{"forename":"Eileen","surname":"Larney"},{"forename":"Carola","surname":"Borries"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Hormones and behavior","firstAuthor":"Lu"},{"id":"6016479194","title":"Environmental Niche Modeling Reveals Climatic Differences among Breeding Ranges of Orchard Oriole Subspecies","type":"Journal Article","volume":"166","issue":"2","url":"http:\/\/www.bioone.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1674\/0003-0031-166.2.404","tags":["2011","birds","conservation","GBIF_used","niche_modeling","SDM","university","US"],"keywords":[],"pages":"404-414","year":"2011","abstract":"Environmental niche parameters of breeding ranges for two subspecies in the Orchard Oriole complex (Icterus spurius spurius and I. s. fuertesi) were characterized via ecological niche modeling.

We focused on the following environmental variables: land cover, elevation and hydrological features.

We conducted a global, fine-scale analysis of patterns of species richness. The richness of mammal species estimated by the overlap of their suitable habitat is on average one-third less than that estimated by the overlap of their geographical ranges. The highest absolute difference is found in tropical and subtropical regions in South America, Africa and Southeast Asia that are not covered by dense forest. The proportion of suitable habitat within mammal geographical ranges correlates with the IUCN Red List category to which they have been assigned, decreasing monotonically from Least Concern to Endangered.

We provide information on the local distribution, seasonal abundance and sex ratio of A.manicatum from samples collected in an intensive two-year survey across Utah, USA. Anthidium man- icatum was detected in 10 of the 29 Utah counties, largely in urban and suburban settings. Combining presence-only and MaxEnt background data from literature, museum databases and new records from Utah, we constructed three species distribution mod- els to examine the potential distribution of A. manic- atum in its native Eurasian range as well as invaded ranges of North and South America. The A. manic- atum model based on locality and background data from the species\u2019 native range predicted 50% of the invasive records associated with high habitat suit- ability (HS C 0.90).

The poor predictive power of the latter model in estimating suitable habitats in the invasive South American range of A. manicatum suggests that the bee may still be limited by the bioclimatic constraints associated with a novel environment. Estimates of niche similarity (D) between the native and invasive models find that the North America bioclimatic niche is more similar to the bioclimatic niche of the native model (D = 0.78), whereas the bioclimatic niche of the South America invasion is relatively dissimilar (D = 0.69).

We used historical and current field records along with climatic and topographic variables to generate three different models (Biomapper, Maxent, and GARP). Using field data on species occurrence, a model was selected based on the accuracy of assessment results. A final model was obtained by eliminating those areas mapped as known unsuitable habitat, using high resolution land use\/land cover data. The GARP model obtained the best accuracy values. It showed the winter distribution of the Black-capped Vireo to cover an area in western Mexico of about 141,000 km2 that runs along the Pacific coast from southern Sonora (R\u00edo Yaqui, Alvaro Obreg\u00f3n Dam) to the southern state of Oaxaca (Salina Cruz on the Pacific coast and Matias Romero, and inland). One third of the proposed model\u2019s area was located at elevations of 0\u2013500 m, while 83% occurred at elevations < 1,250 m; however, a significant area (17%) consists of sites > 1,250 m in elevation. For the most part, the distribution model proposed closely followed the tropical dry forest boundaries and clearly avoided temperate areas at higher elevations.

Since scientific divers represent a small portion of the total number of divers worldwide, the use of non-scientific divers could drastically increase the number of observations needed to monitor broad-scale, long-term trends. Here, we use 83,940 surveys collected by trained volunteer divers to examine spatial and temporal trends of the most frequently sighted elasmobranch species in the greater-Caribbean, the yellow stingray (Urobatis jamaicensis). Despite being relatively common and listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, little is known about the status of this species. In total, yellow stingrays were observed on 5,658 surveys (6.7% sighting frequency) with the highest occurrence in the regions surrounding Cuba. Overall, sighting frequency declined from 20.5% in 1994 to 4.7% in 2007\u2014a standardized decline rate of \u22120.11. However, these trends were not consistent in all regions. The strongest decline occurred in the Florida Keys, the most sampled region, where trends were similar among all areas, habitats and depths. In contrast, sighting frequency significantly increased in Jamaica where large fishes are severely depleted. We discuss possible explanations for these changes including habitat degradation, exploitation and changes in trophic interactions. Our results suggest large-scale changes in yellow stingray abundance that have been unnoticed by the scientific community. Thus, our study highlights the value of non-scientific divers for collecting data that can be used to understand population trends of otherwise poorly studied species.","uuid":"28b48de8-e2f3-3e3a-9335-b8928e6765b2","authors":[{"forename":"Christine A.","surname":"Ward-Paige"},{"forename":"Christy","surname":"Pattengill-Semmens"},{"forename":"Ransom A.","surname":"Myers"},{"forename":"Heike K.","surname":"Lotze"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Ward-Paige"},{"id":"6016478844","title":"Insights from Population Genetics: Are all Crustaceans Created Equal?","type":"Journal Article","volume":"31","issue":"2","url":"http:\/\/www.bioone.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1651\/10-3407.1","tags":["2011","GBIF_used","genetics","marine","phylogeography","university","US"],"keywords":["Cirripedia","cytochrome oxidase I","DNA sequence data","effective population size","Tajima\u2019s D"],"pages":"339-344","year":"2011","abstract":"Reanalysis of aligned sequence data from the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I gene region across Crustacea has generated a number of new insights into how we can interpret genetic variation in these species.

To evaluate whether large-scale abiotic factors can explain a successful introduction of both P. formosa and Poecilia latipinna. Location South-east United States, Mexico and Central America. Methods We used abiotic variables in ecological niche modelling (ENM) to identify regions with suitable conditions for the presence of the Amazon molly and its two parental species (P. latipinna and Poecilia mexicana). We also used a recently developed metric to calculate the degree of niche overlap between the hybrid and its parental species. Results ENM produced highly significant models [all area under the curve (AUC) > 0.99 for the three species]. Annual mean temperature and minimum temperature of the coldest month were the variables that best explained the distribution of the Amazon molly. With the exception of south Florida, few areas beyond the known distribution of the species were predicted to have suitable environmental conditions. The hybrid species niche overlaps partially with the parental species. However, given the available data, it is neither more similar nor more different than expected by chance. Main conclusions Two different processes are acting to limit the distribution of P. formosa. At the northern limit, although a sperm donor species is present further north, suitable environmental conditions are absent from nearby locations. At the southern limit, a sperm donor species is present and areas with good environmental conditions are present at nearby locations, suggesting that dispersal ability is the limiting factor. We found that the hybrid species overlaps in a similar way with both parental species while still having its own niche identity. This result may be explained by the fact that hybrid species inherit characteristics of two ecologically divergent species, which can result in intermediate or even transgressive phenotypes. These results support recent work on the role of hybridization in diversification.","uuid":"4f627e1c-ea03-3fdc-9262-b8e349462054","authors":[{"forename":"Gabriel C.","surname":"Costa"},{"forename":"Ingo","surname":"Schlupp"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Costa"},{"id":"6016476284","title":"Taxonomic Revision of Desmognathus wrighti (Caudata: Plethodontidae)","type":"Journal Article","volume":"66","issue":"3","url":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1655\/HERPETOLOGICA-D-09-00002.1","tags":["2010","GBIF_used","niche_modeling","SDM","species verification","university","US"],"keywords":[],"pages":"283-295","year":"2010","publisher":"The Herpetologists' League","uuid":"1a6f3c58-525d-3711-aa4b-935c67dd435b","authors":[{"forename":"Erica J.","surname":"Crespi"},{"forename":"Robert A.","surname":"Browne"},{"forename":"Leslie","surname":"Rissler"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Crespi"},{"id":"6016476484","title":"Phylogenetic analyses reveal the shady history of C4 grasses","type":"Journal Article","volume":"107","issue":"6","url":"http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/107\/6\/2532.abstract","tags":["2010","GBIF_primary","GBIF_used","plants","US"],"keywords":[],"pages":"2532-2537","year":"2010","abstract":"Grasslands cover more than 20% of the Earth's terrestrial surface, and their rise to dominance is one of the most dramatic events of biome evolution in Earth history. Grasses possess two main photosynthetic pathways: the C3 pathway that is typical of most plants and a specialized C4 pathway that minimizes photorespiration and thus increases photosynthetic performance in high-temperature and\/or low-CO2 environments. C4 grasses dominate tropical and subtropical grasslands and savannas, and C3 grasses dominate the world's cooler temperate grassland regions. This striking pattern has been attributed to C4 physiology, with the implication that the evolution of the pathway enabled C4 grasses to persist in warmer climates than their C3 relatives. We combined geospatial and molecular sequence data from two public archives to produce a 1,230-taxon phylogeny of the grasses with accompanying climate data for all species, extracted from more than 1.1 million herbarium specimens. Here we show that grasses are ancestrally a warm-adapted clade and that C4 evolution was not correlated with shifts between temperate and tropical biomes. Instead, 18 of 20 inferred C4 origins were correlated with marked reductions in mean annual precipitation. These changes are consistent with a shift out of tropical forest environments and into tropical woodland\/savanna systems. We conclude that C4 evolution in grasses coincided largely with migration out of the understory and into open-canopy environments. Furthermore, we argue that the evolution of cold tolerance in certain C3 lineages is an overlooked innovation that has profoundly influenced the patterning of grassland communities across the globe.","uuid":"20ac1b55-3556-3eb0-8f8d-73e13ea7cea4","authors":[{"forename":"Erika J.","surname":"Edwards"},{"forename":"Stephen A.","surname":"Smith"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","firstAuthor":"Edwards"},{"id":"6016475314","title":"Southward Pleistocene migration of Douglas-fir into Mexico: phylogeography, ecological niche modeling, and conservation of \u2018rear edge\u2019 populations","type":"Journal Article","volume":"online","url":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/j.1469-8137.2010.03559.x","tags":["2010","climate","conservation","EE","Estonia","GBIF_used","genetics","Mexico","MX","niche_modeling","SDM","university","US"],"keywords":["cpDNA","cpSSR","ecological niche modeling","Mexico","mtDNA","phylogeography","Pseudotsuga menziesii","rear edge"],"year":"2010","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","abstract":"Summary * \u2022Poleward Pleistocene plant migration has been an important process structuring modern temperate and boreal plant communities, but the contribution of equatorward migration remains poorly understood.

We compared logistic regression (which uses presence\/absence data) and two presence-only methods for modeling the potential distributions of three invasive plant species on the Olympic Peninsula in Washington, USA. We then combined the three methods to create ensemble models. We also developed climate envelope models for the same species based on larger scale distributions and combined models from multiple scales to create an index of near- and long-term invasion risk to inform monitoring in Olympic National Park (ONP). Neither presence-only nor ensemble models were more accurate than logistic regression for any of the species. Larger scale models predicted much greater areas at risk of invasion. Our index of near- and long-term invasion risk indicates that,4% of ONP is at high near-term risk of invasion while 67\u201399%of the Park is at moderate or high long-term risk of invasion. We demonstrate how modeling results can be used to guide the design of monitoring protocols and monitoring results can in turn be used to refine models. We propose that, by using models from multiple scales to predict invasion risk and by explicitly linking model development to monitoring, it may be possible to overcome some of the limitations of habitat distribution models.","uuid":"ec075c93-7bc1-3415-9e43-625315885b4f","authors":[{"forename":"Chad C.","surname":"Jones"},{"forename":"Steven A.","surname":"Acker"},{"forename":"Charles B.","surname":"Halpern"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Jones"},{"id":"6016475234","title":"Biodiversity of the Deep-Sea Continental Margin Bordering the Gulf of Maine (NW Atlantic): Relationships among Sub-Regions and to Shelf Systems","type":"Journal Article","volume":"5","issue":"11","url":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0013832","tags":["2010","CA","Canada","conservation","GBIF_used","marine","species distribution","university","US"],"keywords":[],"pages":"e13832","year":"2010","publisher":"Public Library of Science","abstract":"Background: In contrast to the well-studied continental shelf region of the Gulf of Maine, fundamental questions regarding the diversity, distribution, and abundance of species living in deep-sea habitats along the adjacent continental margin remain unanswered. Lack of such knowledge precludes a greater understanding of the Gulf of Maine ecosystem and limits development of alternatives for conservation and management. Methodology\/Principal Findings: We use data from the published literature, unpublished studies, museum records and online sources, to: (1) assess the current state of knowledge of species diversity in the deep-sea habitats adjacent to the Gulf of Maine (39\u201343\u00b0N, 63\u201371\u00b0W, 150\u20133000 m depth); (2) compare patterns of taxonomic diversity and distribution of megafaunal and macrofaunal species among six distinct sub-regions and to the continental shelf; and (3) estimate the amount of unknown diversity in the region. Known diversity for the deep-sea region is 1,671 species; most are narrowly distributed and known to occur within only one sub-region. The number of species varies by sub-region and is directly related to sampling effort occurring within each. Fishes, corals, decapod crustaceans, molluscs, and echinoderms are relatively well known, while most other taxonomic groups are poorly known. Taxonomic diversity decreases with increasing distance from the continental shelf and with changes in benthic topography. Low similarity in faunal composition suggests the deep-sea region harbours faunal communities distinct from those of the continental shelf. Non-parametric estimators of species richness suggest a minimum of 50% of the deep-sea species inventory remains to be discovered.Conclusions\/Significance:The current state of knowledge of biodiversity in this deep-sea region is rudimentary. Our ability to answer questions is hampered by a lack of sufficient data for many taxonomic groups, which is constrained by sampling biases, life-history characteristics of target species, and the lack of trained taxonomists.","uuid":"a08acd88-e830-3b09-9540-5ac29621b24a","authors":[{"forename":"Noreen E.","surname":"Kelly"},{"forename":"Elizabeth K.","surname":"Shea"},{"forename":"Anna","surname":"Metaxas"},{"forename":"Richard L.","surname":"Haedrich"},{"forename":"Peter J.","surname":"Auster"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Kelly"},{"id":"6016477214","title":"PERSPECTIVE: Underutilized resources for studying the evolution of invasive species during their introduction, establishment, and lag phases","type":"Journal Article","volume":"3","issue":"2","url":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/j.1752-4571.2009.00101.x","tags":["2010","FI","Finland","GBIF_used","invasive","US"],"keywords":["biological control","evolution","horticultural invasion","invasive species","lag phase","natural history collections","specimens"],"pages":"203-219","year":"2010","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","abstract":"Abstract The early phases of biological invasions are poorly understood. In particular, during the introduction, establishment, and possible lag phases, it is unclear to what extent evolution must take place for an introduced species to transition from established to expanding. In this study, we highlight three disparate data sources that can provide insights into evolutionary processes associated with invasion success: biological control organisms, horticultural introductions, and natural history collections. All three data sources potentially provide introduction dates, information about source populations, and genetic and morphological samples at different time points along the invasion trajectory that can be used to investigate preadaptation and evolution during the invasion process, including immediately after introduction and before invasive expansion. For all three data sources, we explore where the data are held, their quality, and their accessibility. We argue that these sources could find widespread use with a few additional pieces of data, such as voucher specimens collected at certain critical time points during biocontrol agent quarantine, rearing, and release and also for horticultural imports, neither of which are currently done consistently. In addition, public access to collected information must become available on centralized databases to increase its utility in ecological and evolutionary research.","uuid":"59e2c354-7bac-349d-b3c8-14189ace7238","authors":[{"forename":"Travis D.","surname":"Marsico"},{"forename":"Jennifer W.","surname":"Burt"},{"forename":"Erin K.","surname":"Espeland"},{"forename":"George W.","surname":"Gilchrist"},{"forename":"Mary A.","surname":"Jamieson"},{"forename":"Leena","surname":"Lindstr\u00f6m"},{"forename":"George K.","surname":"Roderick"},{"forename":"Sarah","surname":"Swope"},{"forename":"Marianna","surname":"Sz\u0171cs"},{"forename":"Neil D.","surname":"Tsutsui"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Evolutionary Applications","firstAuthor":"Marsico"},{"id":"6016476564","title":"The Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Bullous Myringitis Myth","type":"Journal Article","volume":"26","issue":"12","url":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/pec-online\/Fulltext\/2010\/12000\/The_Mycoplasma_pneumoniae_and_Bullous_Myringitis.24.aspx","tags":["2010","GBIF_used","public health","university","US"],"keywords":[],"pages":"966-968","year":"2010","abstract":"Letter to the editor","uuid":"99e821dd-1ed7-3bfe-9f80-1755276ebc49","authors":[{"forename":"Larry B","surname":"Mellick"},{"forename":"Neha","surname":"Verma"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Pediatric emergency care","firstAuthor":"Mellick"},{"id":"6016477014","title":"Variations in alder pollen pore numbers\u2014a possible new correlation tool for the Neogene Kenai lowland, Alaska","type":"Journal Article","volume":"34","issue":"2","url":"http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/01916122.2010.495544","tags":["2010","Alaska_biodiversity","GBIF_used","species distribution","university","US"],"keywords":["Alaska","Alnobetula","Alnus","correlation","Kenai lowland","Neogene","pollen","pores"],"pages":"180-194","year":"2010","abstract":"(Alnus: Betulaceae) pollen grains are common in coal beds of the Miocene Beluga and the Pliocene Sterling formations exposed in the Kenai lowland, Alaska. All alder pollen grains of the Beluga Formation and the lower part of the overlying Sterling Formation are dominated by 4-pored grains (42\u201367% of total alder), with no exceptions. There is a striking transition to a 5-pored dominance (32\u201367%) with an accompanying increase in 6-, 7-, and even 8-pored grains in outcrops of the Sterling Formation along the Cook Inlet shore, north of Clam Gulch and at the head of Kachemak Bay, in upper Swift Creek Canyon, and in two canyon tributaries to Fox Creek. The general zone of this transition includes a previously correlated volcanic ash and gives credence to the rock strata being synchronous in these widely separated outcrops. It should thus be possible to correlate these strata across the Kenai lowland by the alder pore numbers combined with the volcanic ash. The cause of the transition to a \ue002 5-pored Alnus dominance in the Pliocene of the Kenai lowland can only be suggested. Using pore numbers to determine alder species is not an accurate method because pollen of different alder species may have similar percentages of pore numbers. Nevertheless, when taking into account percentages of 5-, 6-, and 7-pored grains combined with the presence or absence of polar arci, it can be suggested that a shift occurred from the 4-pore dominated subgenus Alnus, represented by Alnus incana, to the 5-pore dominated, cold\u2013adapted subgenus Alnobetula through dispersion and hybridization of Asian species such as Alnus maximowiczii, Alnus firma, and possibly Alnus sieboldiana.

Salamanders are of particular conservation interest because they potentially harbor many undescribed species due to morphological conservatism. The dusky salamanders, genus Desmognathus, are a species-rich group in which morphologically cryptic species are especially common. Using a portion of the mitochondrial genome and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), we investigated the genetic diversity of the highly endemic, stream-dwelling salamander, Desmognathus folkertsi, across its known range in the Appalachian Mountains. Mitochondrial data revealed three well-supported lineages, one of which consisted of only one specimen; however, AFLP data were not congruent with the mitochondrial data. There was 1.11% uncorrected sequence divergence between the two well-sampled lineages. Desmognathus folkertsi exhibited 4.29% sequence divergence from the closely related D. quadramaculatus. Isolation by distance was found for both the AFLP and mitochondrial data when stream distance, rather than when straight-line (i.e., geographic) distance was used. Although genetic diversity is often partitioned by river drainages in freshwater taxa, we did not observe such a pattern in D. folkertsi. We propose that human-mediated dispersal by bait-bucket release may augment natural gene flow via aquatic dispersal across streams. Because this species was only recently discovered, the full extent of the geographic range is unknown. Therefore, an ecological niche model, using climate variables and the Maxent algorithm, was used to determine whether additional regions may be suitable for the species. The model predicted a small range limited to extreme southwestern North Carolina and extreme northeastern Georgia. We suggest future surveys be focused in these regions.","uuid":"ca94e2c6-2f91-386a-913c-9e4bc2be5347","authors":[{"forename":"Jessica","surname":"Wooten"},{"forename":"Carlos","surname":"Camp"},{"forename":"Leslie","surname":"Rissler"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Conservation Genetics","firstAuthor":"Wooten"},{"id":"6016478134","title":"Angiosperm wood structure: Global patterns in vessel anatomy and their relation to wood density and potential conductivity","type":"Journal Article","volume":"97","issue":"2","url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21622380","tags":["2010","AU","Australia","GB","GBIF_acknowledged","GBIF_used","species distribution","university","University of Cambridge","US"],"keywords":["angiosperms","evolutionary divergences","potential conductivity","variances","vessel lumen fraction","vessel number","vessel size","wood density","xylem sapwood"],"pages":"207-15","year":"2010","abstract":"Woody stems comprise a large biological carbon fraction and determine water transport between roots and leaves; their structure and function can influence both carbon and hydrological cycles.

Fungi, and to a lesser extent arthropods, represent the most feasible agents for Toxicodendron spp. biological control.","uuid":"be425192-9e19-3c7f-8931-ec8195bcb7c7","authors":[{"forename":"David S.","surname":"Senchina"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Perspectives in Plant Ecology, Evolution and Systematics","firstAuthor":"Senchina"},{"id":"6016476754","title":"Infection by powdery mildew Erysiphe cruciferarum (Erysiphaceae) strongly affects growth and fitness of Alliaria petiolata (Brassicaceae)","type":"Journal Article","volume":"94","issue":"11","url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21636376","tags":["2007","Aichi_B","GBIF_used","invasive","Target_9","university","US"],"keywords":["Alliaria petiolata","biocontrol","Erysiphe cruciferarum","infection","invasive species","plant fitness","plant growth"],"pages":"1813-20","year":"2007","abstract":"Garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata) is an invasive biennial that negatively impacts plant and animal communities throughout North America and lacks significant herbivory in its invasive range. Throughout Ohio, many garlic mustard populations support the powdery mildew fungus Erysiphe cruciferarum, although disease incidence varies among populations and environments. Effects of infection on plant growth, as well as both plant and fungal responses to drought and light conditions, were examined on greenhouse-grown, first-year garlic mustard plants. Also, the effects of the fungus on plant growth and fitness were studied in a naturally growing population of second-year plants in the field. Powdery mildew significantly reduced growth of first-year plants in the greenhouse, eventually causing complete mortality. Simulated drought slowed both plant growth and disease development, independent of light conditions. In the field, plants with little incidence of disease after their first year grew taller during their second year, producing significantly more siliques and twice as many seeds as heavily diseased plants did. Seed germination rates did not differ between plants with different levels of disease severity. Consistent reductions in survival, growth, and fitness caused by fungal infection may reduce populations of garlic mustard. These effects may be more evident in moist sites that favor fungal development.","uuid":"48683366-60a0-31ca-b9c7-a75ba3da6d8b","authors":[{"forename":"Stephanie M.","surname":"Enright"},{"forename":"Don","surname":"Cipollini"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Enright"}]
