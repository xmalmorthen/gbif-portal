Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and Corine (Coordination of Information on the Environment) land cover data for the year 2000 (CLC2000) were processed to extract explanatory variables and divided into three sets; Satellite (ETM+, SRTM), CLC2000 and Combined (CLC2000 + Satellite). Presence-absence data for M. calandra, collected during structured surveys for the Catalan Breeding Bird Atlas, were provided by the Catalan Ornithological Institute. The dataset was partitioned into an equal number of presence and absence points by dividing it into five groups, each composed of 88 randomly selected presence points to match the number of absences. A logistic regression model was then built for each group. Models were evaluated using area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC). Results of the five groups were averaged to produce mean Satellite, CLC2000 and Combined models. The mean AUC values were 0.69, 0.81 and 0.90 for the CLC2000, Satellite and the Combined model, respectively. The probability of M. calandra presence had the strongest positive correlation with land surface temperature, modified soil adjusted vegetation index, coefficient of variation for ETM+ band 5 and the fraction of non-irrigated arable land.","uuid":"c4e3957e-f5e8-3c2a-bc02-d6cf137eaf30","authors":[{"forename":"Abdulhakim","surname":"Abdi"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Abdi"},{"id":"6016482774","title":"Neolovenula alluaudi (Guerne and Richard, 1890) (Calanoida: Diaptomidae: Paradiaptominae): first record in Italy and review of geographical distribution","type":"Journal Article","volume":"72","issue":"2","url":"http:\/\/www.jlimnol.it\/index.php\/jlimnol\/article\/view\/641","tags":["2013","Aichi_E","GBIF_used","GBits_8","IT","Italy","Spain_biodiversity","Target_19"],"keywords":["biogeography","Copepoda","inland waters","Italian fauna","species distribution","zooplankton"],"pages":"251-261","year":"2013","abstract":"As part of recent limnological campaigns in Puglia region (South-Eastern Italy), 217 temporary and permanent ponds were studied.

The method involves the creation of current distribution maps, analysis of threat factors and use of the RAMAS Red List software to facilitate rapid and objective classification of taxa in accordance with 2001 IUCN criteria. In order to ensure a more objective approach by the assessor and reduce the range of uncertainty, an index was created for calculating Risk Tolerance (RT) that enabled adjustment of the results obtained and thus supplemented the software used. For trial purposes, the proposed model was applied to Spanish gypsophilous flora currently protected under Spanish regional legislation. When classified using the new model, the taxa in question were placed in very different categories, ranging from least concern (LC) to endangered (EN), indicating the need to redefine both their current legal status and recommended management measures. Use of this method will enable scientists to optimise available information on the geographical distribution of endangered taxa, and help governments both to optimise their financial investment in conservation and to define their priorities. The authors endorse the use of IUCN categories in legal protection texts, and advocate as essential a greater degree of coordination between scientists and governments.","uuid":"91a08a05-1db5-3e6b-8859-03847af448ca","authors":[{"forename":"Raquel","surname":"Alonso-Redondo"},{"forename":"Elena","surname":"De Paz"},{"forename":"Eduardo","surname":"Alonso-Herrero"},{"forename":"Marta-Eva","surname":"Garc\u00eda-Gonz\u00e1lez"},{"forename":"Estrella","surname":"Alfaro-Saiz"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Journal for Nature Conservation","firstAuthor":"Alonso-Redondo"},{"id":"6016484314","title":"Conservation status of the narrow endemic gypsophile Ononis tridentata subsp. crassifolia in southern Spain: effects of habitat disturbance","type":"Journal Article","volume":"47","issue":"02","url":"http:\/\/www.journals.cambridge.org\/abstract_S0030605312001688","tags":["2013","Aichi_C","conservation","ES","GBIF_used","GBits_8","plants","Spain","Spain_biodiversity","Target_12"],"keywords":["Conservation status","grazing","gypsophile","gypsum quarrying","habitat disturbance","narrow endemic","Ononis tridentata","ploughing"],"pages":"199-202","year":"2013","abstract":"Ononis tridentata L. subsp. crassifolia (Leguminosae) is a narrow endemic plant restricted to gypsum outcrops in south-east Spain.

A combination of traits, including selfing, short lifespan and the ability to tolerate a wide variety of substrates, were key factors underlying range expansion after long-distance dispersal throughout the Mediterranean basin. By contrast, self-incompatibility may have promoted higher diversification rates in narrow ranges of the Iberian Peninsula. We argue that a few traits contributed to the adoption of two contrasting strategies that may have been predominant in the evolution of Mediterranean angiosperms.","uuid":"b39ec4df-8cc1-30e6-88e8-29765ecab5e7","authors":[{"forename":"J.

The Pyrenean desman, Galemys pyrenaicus, is a small semi-aquatic mammal that inhabits clean streams of the northern half of the Iberian Peninsula and is endangered in most of its geographic range, but its genetic structure is currently unknown. While the stringent ecological demands derived from its aquatic habitat might have caused a partition of the genetic diversity among river basins, Pleistocene glaciations would have generated a genetic pattern related to glacial refugia. Results To study the relative importance of historical and ecological factors in the genetic structure of G. pyrenaicus, we used mitochondrial and intronic sequences of specimens covering most of the species range. We show, first, that the Pyrenean desman has very low levels of genetic diversity compared to other mammals. In addition, phylogenetic and dating analyses of the mitochondrial sequences reveal a strong phylogeographic structure of a Middle Pleistocene origin, suggesting that the main lineages arose during periods of glacial isolation. Furthermore, both the spatial distribution of nuclear and mitochondrial diversity and the results of species distribution modeling suggest the existence of a major glacial refugium in the northwestern part of the Iberian Peninsula. Finally, the main mitochondrial lineages show a striking parapatric distribution without any apparent exchange of mitochondrial haplotypes between the lineages that came into secondary contact (although with certain permeability to nuclear genes), indicating incomplete mixing after the post-glacial recolonization. On the other hand, when we analyzed the partition of the genetic diversity among river basins, the Pyrenean desman showed a lower than expected genetic differentiation among main rivers. Conclusions The analysis of mitochondrial and intronic markers in G. pyrenaicus showed the predominant effects of Pleistocene glaciations on the genetic structure of this species, while the distribution of the genetic diversity was not greatly influenced by the main river systems. These results and, particularly, the discovery of a marked phylogeographic structure, may have important implications for the conservation of the Pyrenean desman.","uuid":"2b087440-dfb6-37c1-96bb-db2d6cbe36a0","authors":[{"forename":"Javier","surname":"Igea"},{"forename":"Pere","surname":"Aymerich"},{"forename":"Angel","surname":"Fern\u00e1ndez-Gonz\u00e1lez"},{"forename":"Jorge","surname":"Gonz\u00e1lez-Esteban"},{"forename":"Asunci\u00f3n","surname":"G\u00f3mez"},{"forename":"Roc\u00edo","surname":"Alonso"},{"forename":"Joaquim","surname":"Gos\u00e1lbez"},{"forename":"Jose","surname":"Castresana"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"BMC evolutionary biology","firstAuthor":"Igea"},{"id":"6181069334","title":"Harvestmen of the BOS Arthropod Collection of the University of Oviedo (Spain) (Arachnida, Opiliones)","type":"Journal Article","volume":"341","url":"http:\/\/www.pensoft.net\/journals\/zookeys\/article\/6130\/abstract\/harvestmen-of-the-bos-arthropod-collection-of-the-university-of-oviedo-spain-arachnida-opiliones-","tags":["2013","Aichi_E","datapaper","ecology","ES","GBIF_used","GBits_11","Portugal_biodiversity","Spain","Spain_biodiversity","Target_19","taxonomy"],"keywords":[],"pages":"21-36","year":"2013","abstract":"There are significant gaps in accessible knowledge about the distribution and phenology of Iberian harvestmen (Arachnida: Opiliones).

Invasive species are one of the most severe threats to biodiversity, and an ability to predict the extent of potential invasions can help conservation strategies. Species distribution models (SDMs) have been widely used to project the potential range of invasive species. These models assume that species retain their niche properties during invasion (niche conservatism), although this assumption is seldom verified. 2. We gathered occurrence records for the crayfish Procambarus clarkii from the U.S.A. and Mexico (native + invasive ranges) and from the Iberian Peninsula (invasive) to test for niche conservatism across continents using niche overlap metrics (Schoener\u2019s D). To test for differences in the climate space occupied by the species on the different continents, we performed two principal component analyses (PCAs) on the environmental data extracted from occurrence records: first, separately for each occurrence data set (i.e. each continent) and secondly, using the pooled data. Subsequently, we projected the model to South America, where this species has the potential to become invasive. 3. Schoener\u2019s D showed high overlap (0.68) between the two regions (the Americas and Iberia), and there was no difference between the regions in both PCAs. The crayfish has conserved its niche across continents, and therefore, our model projection to South America may accurately demonstrate where invasion is most likely to occur. 4. Large parts of South America are apparently suitable, mainly Argentina, Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay and southern Brazil. This result is of great concern since this invasive species can spread quickly in suitable areas. Stronger laws and regulations should be made to protect native biodiversity and agri- cultural land.

The aim of the present study was to determine whether the distribution of the Lusitanian plant species Daboecia cantabrica was due to persistence in separate Irish and Iberian refugia, or has resulted from post-glacial recolonization followed by subsequent extinction of intervening populations. Location Northern Spain and Co. Galway, western Ireland. Methods Palaeodistribution modelling using Maxent was employed to iden- tify putative refugial areas for D. cantabrica at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Phylogeographical analysis of samples from 64 locations in Ireland and Spain were carried out using a chloroplast marker (atpB\u2013rbcL), the nuclear ITS region, and an anonymous nuclear single-copy locus. Results The palaeodistribution model indicated areas with a high probability of survival for D. cantabrica at the LGM off the western coast of Galicia in Spain, and in the Bay of Biscay. Spanish populations exhibited substantially higher genetic diversity than Irish populations at all three loci, as well as geo- graphical structuring of haplotypes within Spain consistent with divergence in separate refugia. Spanish populations also exhibited far more endemic haplo- types. Divergence time between Irish and Spanish populations associated with the putative Biscay refugium was estimated as 3.333\u201332 ka. Main conclusions Our data indicate persistence by D. cantabrica throughout the LGM in two separate southern refugia: one in western Galicia and one in the area off the coast of western France which now lies in the Bay of Biscay. Spain was recolonized from both refugia, whilst Ireland was most likely recol- onized from the Biscay refugium. On the balance of evidence across the three marker types and the palaeodistribution modelling, our findings do not sup- port the idea of in situ survival of D. cantabrica in Ireland, contrary to earlier suggestions. The fact that we cannot conclusively rule out the existence of a small, more northerly refugium, however, highlights the need for further analy- sis of Lusitanian plant species.","uuid":"3d43665e-8b9d-396d-b0cf-43f2d296346a","authors":[{"forename":"Gemma E.","surname":"Beatty"},{"forename":"Jim","surname":"Provan"}],"editors":[{"forename":"Hans-Peter","surname":"Comes"}],"publication_outlet":"Journal of Biogeography","firstAuthor":"Beatty"},{"id":"6016482254","title":"How plant inventories improve future monitoring","type":"Journal Article","volume":"online","url":"http:\/\/www.springerlink.com\/index\/10.1007\/s10531-012-0286-2","tags":["2012","conservation","ES","GBIF_used","South Africa","South Africa_biodiversity","Spain","Spain_biodiversity","US","USA_biodiversity","ZA"],"keywords":["Categories of threat","Hollow curve","Lognormal distribution","Mediterranean plant conservation","Rarity","Sample size","Skewness","Threatened plants"],"year":"2012","abstract":"Plant inventories are at the heart of conservation efforts.

A lognormal distribution is better fitted by SA, followed by CA and finally by SP, which is least suited to a lognormal fit. Using the most threatened portion of the three floras, these general patterns still apply. Secondly, a minimum sample analysis indicates that precision increases according to sample size. Proportionally, CA data require less sampling effort than the Spanish pool and the latter require less than do SA in order to get a clear monitoring trend. Larger skewness values are related to inventories with wider scope. SA Proteas display the most skewed distribution. Skewness in California may be explained not only by the nature and scope of the inventory but also by the scale used for mapping. The Spanish database is also affected by surveyor bias towards the most endangered portion of the data set. Monitoring should take into account the original nature of each inventory. Particular inventory methods and scope may produce different outputs, constraining future monitoring programs. Key aspects are skewness and variation, and both combined could identify inventories in need of better data collection practices for more precise estimates of changes in biodiversity.","uuid":"4b8f0974-ad26-3d68-ac65-54c24758a8ac","authors":[{"forename":"F.","surname":"Dom\u00ednguez Lozano"},{"forename":"A.

Location Macaronesia, Mediterranean, Atlantic fringe of Europe. Methods Patterns of genetic diversity are described based on variation at two chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) loci and one nuclear DNA (nDNA) locus for 109 accessions across the entire distribution range of the species. Global patterns of genetic differentiation were investigated using principal coordinates analysis. Genetic differentiation between island and continental areas, estimations of pollen- and seed-mediated gene flow, and the presence of phylogeographical signal were assessed by means of Fst\/NST (continental scale) and Fij\/Nij (local scale). Extant and past distribution ranges of the species were inferred from niche modelling using layers describing present and Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) macroclimatic conditions. Results The Azores exhibited a significantly higher genetic diversity than the continent. The lowest levels of genetic differentiation were observed between the Azores and the western Mediterranean, and the diversity observed in the Azores resulted from at least two colonization waves. Within the Azores, kinship coefficients showed a significant and much steeper decrease with geographical distance in the cpDNA than in the nDNA. The distribution predicted by LGM models was markedly different from the current potential distribution, particularly in western Europe, where no suitable areas were predicted by LGM models, and along the Atlantic coast of the African continent, where LGM models predicted highly suitable climatic conditions. Main conclusions The higher diversity observed in Azorean than in continental populations is inconsistent with MacArthur and Wilson\u2019s equilibrium model and derived theoretical population genetic expectations. This inverted pattern may be the result of extinction on the continent coupled with multiple island colonization events and subsequent allopatric diversification and lineage hybridization in the Azores. The results highlight the role of allopatric diversification in explaining diversification on islands and suggest that this process has played a much more significant role in shaping Azorean biodiversity than previously thought.","uuid":"29778d10-33ff-3fe2-a049-6c1e6afc42ee","authors":[{"forename":"Aur\u00e9lie","surname":"D\u00e9samor\u00e9"},{"forename":"B.","surname":"Laenen"},{"forename":"Juana-Mar\u00eda","surname":"Gonz\u00e1lez-Mancebo"},{"forename":"R.","surname":"Ja\u00e9n Molina"},{"forename":"Nadia","surname":"Bystriakova"},{"forename":"E.","surname":"Martinez-Klimova"},{"forename":"M.

Although the theoretical framework for protected areas has been long known and discussed, there are few data about their practical effectiveness as a means to preserve biodiversity. Through the analysis of information from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), we have looked for any relationship between the protection status and the general species richness (i.e., number of all living species, taken as a surrogate for biodiversity) in the Spanish Pyrenees. We found that higher protection levels were associated to higher richness of non-endangered species. However, additional reliability tests have shown that for endangered species, the amount of currently available data may still be insufficient for effective management. To avoid this lack of reliability, enhancing public access to biodiversity data or improving sampling effort is mandatory.","uuid":"b6769516-7149-3670-845d-f813d12f08ed","authors":[{"forename":"Javier","surname":"Otegui"},{"forename":"Ana","surname":"Villarroya"},{"forename":"Arturo H.","surname":"Ari\u00f1o"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Environmental Engineering and Management Journal","firstAuthor":"Otegui"},{"id":"6016479874","title":"Occurrence of Lophogaster spinosus Ortmann, 1906 (Crustacea, Lophogastrida) in the Gulf of Cadiz (NE Atlantic)","type":"Journal Article","volume":"9","url":"http:\/\/amz.museucienciesjournals.cat\/volum-09-2011-amz\/occurrence-of-lophogaster-spinosus-ortmann-1906-crustacea-lophogastrida-in-the-gulf-of-cadiz-ne-atlantic\/?lang=en","tags":["2011","Aichi_E","ES","GBIF_used","GBits_8","marine","Spain","Spain_biodiversity","Target_19"],"keywords":["Gulf of Cadiz","Lophogaster spinosus","Lophogastrida","North\u2013eastern Atlantic"],"pages":"6-12","year":"2011","abstract":"Occurrence of Lophogaster spinosus Ortmann, 1906 (Crustacea, Lophogastrida) in the Gulf of Cadiz (NE Atlantic).\u2014 The occurrence of the lophogastrid crustacean Lophogaster spinosus is reported for the Gulf of Cadiz waters, in the North\u2013East Atlantic.

This method includes the application of geographic information systems, ecogeographical land characterization maps, species distribution models and gap analysis to identify prioritized collecting sites. To evaluate the efficiency of this collecting method, field collecting expeditions were carried out focusing on prioritized sites and the results of these collections were analyzed. Prioritized sites were identified using spatial and ecogeographical gaps, and potential species richness maps. The spatial gaps corresponded to populations non-included in the collection but recorded by other information sources while ecogeographical gaps corre- sponded to spatial gaps that were located in ecogeographical categories (obtained from the ecogeographical map) that were scarcely represented in the collection. A potential Lupinus species richness map was obtained by adding the information of single maps of Lupinus species distribution models. Subsequently, prioritized sites were obtained in ecogeo- graphical gaps with high potential species richness values. Collecting expeditions were made in Spain in 2006, 2007 and 2008. Results showed that using the efficient germplasm collecting methodology was highly positive not only from a quantitative viewpoint (between 7.8 and 11% increase) but also in qualitative terms, focusing collection efforts in ecogeographical categories with low or null representation in the Spanish Lupinus collection (41% of the new accessions). Phenotypic differences related to adaptation to environment were observed in the field between the populations that grow in low or null represented categories and those that grow in highly represented categories.","uuid":"e0bf0e2a-3dbc-334b-9304-5aaa9247cc96","authors":[{"forename":"Mauricio","surname":"Parra-Quijano"},{"forename":"Jos\u00e9 M.","surname":"Iriondo"},{"forename":"E.","surname":"Torres"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Biodiversity and Conservation","firstAuthor":"Parra-Quijano"},{"id":"6016476144","title":"Regional assessment of plant invasions across different habitat types","type":"Journal Article","volume":"18","issue":"1","url":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1658\/1100-9233(2007)18[35:RAOPIA]2.0.CO;2","tags":["2007","Aichi_B","ES","GBIF_used","invasive","Spain","Spain_biodiversity","Target_9","university"],"keywords":["Alien plant","EUNIS","Mediterranean community","Relev\u00e9","Species richness","Vegetation type"],"pages":"35","year":"2007","abstract":"Questions: 1. Which habitats have the highest degree of invasion? 2. Do native species-rich communities have also a high degree of invasion? 3. Do the patterns of association between native and alien species richness vary between habitats. Location: Catalonia region (NE Spain). Methods: We conducted a large regional analysis of 15 655 phytosociological relev\u00e9s to detect differences in the degree of invasion between European Nature Information System (EUNIS) habitats representative of temperate and Mediterranean European areas. Results: Alien species were present in less than 17 % of the relev\u00e9s and represented less than 2% of the total number of species per habitat. The EUNIS habitats with the highest alien species richness were arable land and gardens followed by anthropogenic forb-rich habitats, riverine and lakeshore scrubs, southern riparian galleries and thickets and trampled areas. In contrast, the following habitats had never any alien species: surface running waters, raised and blanket bogs, valley mires, poor fens and transition mires, base-rich fens, alpine and sub-alpine grasslands, sub-alpine moist or wet tall-herb and fern habitats, alpine and sub-alpine scrub habitats and spiny Mediterranean heaths. There was a unimodal relationship between the mean native and mean alien species richness per EUNIS habitat with a high number of aliens in habitats with intermediate number of native species and a low number of aliens at both extremes of the native species gradient. Within EUNIS habitats, the relationship was positive, negative or non-significant depending on the habitat type without any clear pattern related to the number of native species. Alien species richness was not related to plot size, neither between habitats nor within habitats. Conclusions: The analysis emphasised that the habitats with a higher degree of invasion were the most disturbed ones and that in general habitats rich in native species did not harbour less invaders than habitats poor in native species.","uuid":"71465ba3-4082-36f4-8d93-1e0d572f83ef","authors":[{"forename":"Vil\u00e0","surname":"Montserrat"},{"forename":"Pino","surname":"Joan"},{"forename":"Font","surname":"Xavier"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Journal of Vegetation Science","firstAuthor":"Montserrat"}]
