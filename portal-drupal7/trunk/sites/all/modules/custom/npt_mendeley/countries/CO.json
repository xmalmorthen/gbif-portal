However, their utilisation is hampered by a lack of systematic conservation which in turn is due to a lack of clarity over their identity. We used gene pool and taxon group concepts to estimate CWR relatedness for 173 priority crops to create the Harlan and de Wet inventory of globally important CWR taxa.

Two approaches for the selection of priority populations for conservation were used, differing in the way they optimize representation of intra-specific diversity of P. africana across a minimum number of populations. The first method (S1) was aimed at maximizing genetic diversity of the conservation units and their distinctiveness with regard to climatic conditions, the second method (S2) at optimizing representativeness of the genetic diversity found throughout the species\u2019 range. Populations in East African countries (especially Kenya and Tanzania) were found to be of great conservation value, as suggested by previous findings. These populations are complemented by those in Madagascar and Cameroon. The combination of the two methods for prioritization led to the identification of a set of 6 priority populations. The potential distribution of P. africana was then modeled based on a dataset of 1,500 georeferenced observations. This enabled an assessment of whether the priority populations identified are exposed to threats from agricultural expansion and climate change, and whether they are located within the boundaries of protected areas. The range of the species has been affected by past climate change and the modeled distribution of P. africana indicates that the species is likely to be negatively affected in future, with an expected decrease in distribution by 2050. Based on these insights, further research at the regional and national scale is recommended, in order to strengthen P. africana conservation efforts.","uuid":"94835341-933e-324a-9094-680d017f9471","authors":[{"forename":"Barbara","surname":"Vinceti"},{"forename":"Judy","surname":"Loo"},{"forename":"Hannes","surname":"Gaisberger"},{"forename":"Maarten J.","surname":"van Zonneveld"},{"forename":"Silvio","surname":"Schueler"},{"forename":"Heino","surname":"Konrad"},{"forename":"Caroline a.

A possible explanation for this pattern is that the narrow thermal tolerances of tropical species and greater climatic stratification of tropical mountains create more opportunities for climate-associated parapatric or allopatric speciation in the tropics relative to the temperate zone. However, it is unclear whether a general relationship exists among latitude, climatic zonation and the ecology of speciation. Recent taxon-specific studies obtained different results regarding the role of climate in speciation in tropical versus temperate areas. Here, we quantify overlap in the climatic distributions of 93 pairs of sister species of mammals, birds, amphibians and reptiles restricted to either the New World tropics or to the Northern temperate zone. We show that elevational ranges of tropical- and temperate-zone species do not differ from one another, yet the temperature range experienced by species in the temperate zone is greater than for those in the tropics. Moreover, tropical sister species tend to exhibit greater similarity in their climatic distributions than temperate sister species. This pattern suggests that evolutionary conservatism in the thermal niches of tropical taxa, coupled with the greater thermal zonation of tropical mountains, may result in increased opportunities for allopatric isolation, speciation and the accumulation of species in tropical montane regions. Our study exemplifies the power of combining phylogenetic and spatial datasets of global climatic variation to explore evolutionary (rather than purely ecological) explanations for the high biodiversity of tropical montane regions.","uuid":"3cbc26c3-f118-3b8a-9b77-f3e24c5799e5","authors":[{"forename":"Carlos Daniel","surname":"Cadena"},{"forename":"Kenneth H.","surname":"Kozak"},{"forename":"Juan Pablo","surname":"G\u00f3mez"},{"forename":"Juan Luis","surname":"Parra"},{"forename":"Christy M.","surname":"McCain"},{"forename":"Rauri C.

Results The projected near-present distribution parameterized with 314 presence points related well to the known geographic distribution in the study region. Different model experiments suggest that the range of An. albimanus based on near-present climate surfaces covered at least 1.27 million km2 in the M-C, although 2080 range was projected to decrease to 1.19 million km2. Modeled p(s) was generally highest in Mesoamerica where many of the original specimens were collected.

Conclusions MaxEnt experiments with near present and future climate data suggest that An. albimanus is likely to invade high-altitude (>2,000 m) areas by 2080 and therefore place many more people at risk of malaria in the M-C region even though latitudinal range expansion may be limited.","uuid":"d8940705-4157-3936-86f4-52ea7890f76a","authors":[{"forename":"Douglas O.","surname":"Fuller"},{"forename":"Martha L.","surname":"Ahumada"},{"forename":"Martha L.","surname":"Qui\u00f1ones"},{"forename":"S\u00f3crates","surname":"Herrera"},{"forename":"John C.","surname":"Beier"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Fuller"},{"id":"6016483814","title":"Spatial and temporal patterns of genetic variation in the widespread antitropical deep-sea coral Paragorgia arborea.","type":"Journal Article","volume":"online","url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23094936","tags":["2012","Aichi_E","CO","Colombia","GBIF_used","Global_biodiversity","in_press","marine","Target_19","US"],"keywords":["coral","deep sea","DNA barcoding","phylogeography","species","widespread"],"year":"2012","abstract":"Numerous deep-sea species have apparent widespread and discontinuous distributions.

Previous studies have examined the genetic diversity of some of these taxa in a regional context, suggesting that genetic differentiation does not occur at scales of discrete features such as seamounts or canyons, but at larger scales (e.g. ocean basins). However, to date, few studies have evaluated such diversity throughout the known distribution of a putative deep-sea species. We utilized sequences from seven mitochondrial gene regions and nuclear genetic variants of the deep-sea coral Paragorgia arborea in a phylogeographic context to examine the global patterns of genetic variation and their possible correlation with the spatial variables of geographic position and depth. We also examined the compatibility of this morphospecies with the genealogical-phylospecies concept by examining specimens collected worldwide. We show that the morphospecies P. arborea can be defined as a genealogical-phylospecies, in contrast to the hypothesis that P. arborea represents a cryptic species complex. Genetic variation is correlated with geographic location at the basin-scale level, but not with depth. Additionally, we present a phylogeographic hypothesis in which P. arborea originates from the North Pacific, followed by colonization of the Southern Hemisphere prior to migration to the North Atlantic. This hypothesis is consistent with the latest ocean circulation model for the Miocene.","uuid":"061447fb-e521-36b3-b417-e347fff7dabf","authors":[{"forename":"S\u00f3crates","surname":"Herrera"},{"forename":"T.

However, cacao\u2019s distribution of genetic diversity in South America is also likely to reflect pre-Columbian human influences that were superimposed on natural processes of genetic differentiation. Here we present the results of a spatial analysis of the intra-specific diversity of cacao in Latin America, drawing on a dataset of 939 cacao trees genotypically characterized by means of 96 SSR markers. To assess continental diversity patterns we performed grid-based calculations of allelic richness, Shannon diversity and Nei gene diversity, and distinguished different spatially coherent genetic groups by means of cluster analysis. The highest levels of genetic diversity were observed in the Upper Amazon areas from southern Peru to the Ecuadorian Amazon and the border areas between Colombia, Peru and Brazil. On the assumption that the last glaciation (22,000\u201313,000 BP) had the greatest pre-human impact on the current distribution and diversity of cacao, we modeled the species\u2019 Pleistocene niche suitability and overlaid this with present-day diversity maps. The results suggest that cacao was already widely distributed in the Western Amazon before the onset of glaciation. During glaciations, cacao populations were likely to have been restricted to several refugia where they probably underwent genetic differentiation, resulting in a number of genetic clusters which are representative for, or closest related to, the original wild cacao populations. The analyses also suggested that genetic differentiation and geographical distribution of a number of other clusters seem to have been significantly affected by processes of human management and accompanying genetic bottlenecks. We discuss the implications of these results for future germplasm collection and in situ, on farm and ex situ conservation of cacao.","uuid":"321c88a7-d478-3413-8d9f-6091c8d0b747","authors":[{"forename":"Evert","surname":"Thomas"},{"forename":"Maarten van","surname":"Zonneveld"},{"forename":"Judy","surname":"Loo"},{"forename":"Toby","surname":"Hodgkin"},{"forename":"Gea","surname":"Galluzzi"},{"forename":"Jacob van","surname":"Etten"}],"editors":[{"forename":"Dorian Q.","surname":"Fuller"}],"publication_outlet":"PLoS ONE","firstAuthor":"Thomas"},{"id":"6016479294","title":"MartiTracks: a geometrical approach for identifying geographical patterns of distribution.","type":"Journal Article","volume":"6","issue":"4","url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0018460","tags":["2011","CO","Colombia","GBIF_used","species distribution","university"],"keywords":["Biodiversity","Biogeography","Biology","Computational Biology","Computer Science","Conservation science","Ecology","Engineering","Environmental systems modeling","Geoinformatics","Research Article","Software engineering","Software tools"],"pages":"e18460","year":"2011","publisher":"Public Library of Science","abstract":"Panbiogeography represents an evolutionary approach to biogeography, using rational cost-efficient methods to reduce initial complexity to locality data, and depict general distribution patterns. However, few quantitative, and automated panbiogeographic methods exist. In this study, we propose a new algorithm, within a quantitative, geometrical framework, to perform panbiogeographical analyses as an alternative to more traditional methods. The algorithm first calculates a minimum spanning tree, an individual track for each species in a panbiogeographic context. Then the spatial congruence among segments of the minimum spanning trees is calculated using five congruence parameters, producing a general distribution pattern. In addition, the algorithm removes the ambiguity, and subjectivity often present in a manual panbiogeographic analysis. Results from two empirical examples using 61 species of the genus Bomarea (2340 records), and 1031 genera of both plants and animals (100118 records) distributed across the Northern Andes, demonstrated that a geometrical approach to panbiogeography is a feasible quantitative method to determine general distribution patterns for taxa, reducing complexity, and the time needed for managing large data sets.","uuid":"658f1673-6c63-3945-a382-ff81e09df3d2","authors":[{"forename":"Susy","surname":"Echeverr\u00eda-Londo\u00f1o"},{"forename":"Daniel Rafael","surname":"Miranda-Esquivel"}],"editors":[{"forename":"Robert","surname":"DeSalle"}],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Echeverr\u00eda-Londo\u00f1o"},{"id":"6016479604","title":"Threats to cassava production: known and potential geographic distribution of four key biotic constraints","type":"Journal Article","volume":"3","issue":"3","url":"http:\/\/www.springerlink.com\/index\/10.1007\/s12571-011-0141-4","tags":["2011","agriculture","Annual Report","CO","Colombia","GBIF_used","GBIF_VIP","niche_modeling","SDM"],"keywords":["cassava","cassava brown streak disease","distribution","ecological modeling","geographic","green mite","mosaic disease","whitefly"],"pages":"329-345","year":"2011","abstract":"Insect pests and plant diseases reduce cassava yields substantially, posing a threat to food security throughout the developing world. While agricultural scientists have recognized these threats, few assessments of the geographic distribution of cassava pests and diseases have been made at the global scale. The goal of this study is to make such an evaluation for four key biotic constraints to cassava production in developing countries: whiteflies, cassava green mites, cassava mosaic disease and cassava brown streak disease. Occurrence records were obtained from laboratory and biodiversity databases and from the scientific literature. These records were then used in ecological niche models to predict the potential distribution of cassava pests and diseases. The distribution maps were cross validated by holding back 20% of the occurrence records. Potential distribution maps were developed by combining the results of the best ecological niche models. Hotspots for potential cassava pest and disease outbreaks include the Mato Grosso in Brazil, northern South America, the African rift valley, the southern tip of India and much of Southeast Asia, where all four biotic constraints show high potential suitability. Our work highlights how potential geographical shifts in infestation hotspots for several cassava biotic constraints will require intensified monitoring, evaluation and research to prevent yield losses and ensure food security.","uuid":"317fe437-0ca2-3ad2-acbc-347a60e1f07e","authors":[{"forename":"Beatriz Vanessa","surname":"Herrera Campo"},{"forename":"Glenn","surname":"Hyman"},{"forename":"Anthony","surname":"Bellotti"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Food Security","firstAuthor":"Herrera Campo"},{"id":"6016479134","title":"A global approach to crop wild relative conservation: securing the gene pool for food and agriculture","type":"Journal Article","volume":"65","issue":"4","url":"http:\/\/www.springerlink.com\/index\/10.1007\/s12225-011-9253-4","tags":["2011","agriculture","CO","Colombia","conservation","GB","GBIF_used","IT","Italy","university"],"keywords":["conservation","crop diversity","crop wild relatives","food and","genetic diversity","plant genetic resources for"],"pages":"561-576","year":"2011","abstract":"In light of the growing concern over the potentially devastating impacts on biodiversity and food security of climate change and the massively growing world population, taking action to conserve crop wild relatives (CWR), is no longer an option \u2014 it is a priority.

Invasive species modify ecosystem structure and functioning and climatic changes are likely to produce invasive species' range shifts pushing some populations into protected areas. The American Bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus) is one of the hundred worst invasive species in the world. Native from the southeast of USA, it has colonized more than 75% of South America where it has been reported as a highly effective predator, competitor and vector of amphibian diseases. Methodology\/Principal Findings: We modeled the potential distribution of the bullfrog in its native range based on different climate models and green-house gases emission scenarios, and projected the results onto South America for the years of 2050 and 2080. We also overlaid projected models onto the South American network of protected areas. Our results indicate a slight decrease in potential suitable area for bullfrog invasion, although protected areas will become more climatically suitable. Therefore, invasion of these sites is forecasted. Conclusion\/Significance: We provide new evidence supporting the vulnerability of the Atlantic Forest Biodiversity Hotspot to bullfrog invasion and call attention to optimal future climatic conditions of the Andean-Patagonian forest, eastern Paraguay, and northwestern Bolivia, where invasive populations have not been found yet. We recommend several management and policy strategies to control bullfrog invasion and argue that these would be possible if based on appropriate articulation among government agencies, NGOs, research institutions and civil society.","uuid":"50cab368-70a6-3666-95ae-b27c84651ba5","authors":[{"forename":"Javier","surname":"Nori"},{"forename":"J.

This method includes the application of geographic information systems, ecogeographical land characterization maps, species distribution models and gap analysis to identify prioritized collecting sites. To evaluate the efficiency of this collecting method, field collecting expeditions were carried out focusing on prioritized sites and the results of these collections were analyzed. Prioritized sites were identified using spatial and ecogeographical gaps, and potential species richness maps. The spatial gaps corresponded to populations non-included in the collection but recorded by other information sources while ecogeographical gaps corre- sponded to spatial gaps that were located in ecogeographical categories (obtained from the ecogeographical map) that were scarcely represented in the collection. A potential Lupinus species richness map was obtained by adding the information of single maps of Lupinus species distribution models. Subsequently, prioritized sites were obtained in ecogeo- graphical gaps with high potential species richness values. Collecting expeditions were made in Spain in 2006, 2007 and 2008. Results showed that using the efficient germplasm collecting methodology was highly positive not only from a quantitative viewpoint (between 7.8 and 11% increase) but also in qualitative terms, focusing collection efforts in ecogeographical categories with low or null representation in the Spanish Lupinus collection (41% of the new accessions).

Ecogeographical land characterization (ELC) maps constitute a new tool in this direction with great potential. To assess the usefulness of this approach, an ELC map of Spain was created through multivariate methods. Its performance to characterize plant habitat preferences was compared with existing ecological regions and land cover maps. Collecting sites and seed weight from eight plant species were used to test the ELC map. Categories from each map were assigned to accessions using collecting sites. Chi-square tests were applied to test if category frequency distributions for each species followed a distribution proportional to the relative frequency of categories in each map. The tests found significant differences in the eight species studied. Thus, Bonferroni confidence intervals (BCI) classified categories from maps in preferred, neutral or avoided habitats. Seed weight was used as a proxy for plant adaptation. Comparison between observed and expected ranking of BCI and quartile classes in terms of seed weight means, and GLM and post-hoc tests carried out to test the effect of these classes upon seed weight showed consistently better results for the ELC map.
