Evidence for such range dynamics and refugia in the unglaciated Gulf-Atlantic Coastal Plain stems largely from terrestrial species, and aquatic species Pleistocene responses remain relatively uninvestigated. Heterandria formosa, a wide-ranging regional endemic, presents an ideal system to test the expansion-contraction model within this biota. By integrating ecological niche modeling and phylogeography, we infer the Pleistocene history of this livebearing fish (Poeciliidae) and test for several predicted distributional and genetic effects of the last glaciation. RESULTS: Paleoclimatic models predicted range contraction to a single southwest Florida peninsula refugium during the Last Glacial Maximum, followed by northward expansion. We inferred spatial-population subdivision into four groups that reflect genetic barriers outside this refuge. Several other features of the genetic data were consistent with predictions derived from an expansion-contraction model: limited intraspecific divergence (e.g. mean mtDNA p-distance = 0.66%); a pattern of mtDNA diversity (mean Hd = 0.934; mean pi = 0.007) consistent with rapid, recent population expansion; a lack of mtDNA isolation-by-distance; and clinal variation in allozyme diversity with higher diversity at lower latitudes near the predicted refugium. Statistical tests of mismatch distributions and coalescent simulations of the gene tree lent greater support to a scenario of post-glacial expansion and diversification from a single refugium than to any other model examined (e.g. multiple-refugia scenarios). CONCLUSIONS: Congruent results from diverse data indicate H. formosa fits the classic Pleistocene expansion-contraction model, even as the genetic data suggest additional ecological influences on population structure. While evidence for Plio-Pleistocene Gulf Coast vicariance is well described for many freshwater species presently codistributed with H. formosa, this species demography and diversification departs notably from this pattern. Species-specific expansion-contraction dynamics may therefore have figured more prominently in shaping Coastal Plain evolutionary history than previously thought. Our findings bolster growing appreciation for the complexity of phylogeographical structuring within North America's southern refugia, including responses of Coastal Plain freshwater biota to Pleistocene climatic fluctuations.","uuid":"3d4d4b6a-7414-3125-b57f-df08eea61c39","authors":[{"forename":"Justin C.","surname":"Bagley"},{"forename":"Michael","surname":"Sandel"},{"forename":"Joseph","surname":"Travis"},{"forename":"Mar\u00eda De","surname":"Lozano-Vilano"},{"forename":"Jerald B.","surname":"Johnson"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Bagley"},{"id":"6016481514","title":"Mammal species richness and biogeographic structure at the southern boundaries of the Nearctic region","type":"Journal Article","url":"http:\/\/www.degruyter.com\/view\/j\/mamm.ahead-of-print\/mammalia-2013-0057\/mammalia-2013-0057.xml","tags":["2013","Aichi_E","GBIF_used","GBits_10","in_press","Maxent","Mexico","MX","North America_biodiversity","SDM","Target_19"],"keywords":["diversity","endemicity","North America","richness estimators","species distribution models"],"pages":"1-11","year":"2013","abstract":"We analyzed whether the spatial variation in mammal species richness reflects the southern bounda- ries of the Nearctic region as previously established by endemism patterns.

Two Robsonius species are currently recognized on the basis of plumage differences: R. rabori from northern Luzon in the Cordillera Central and the northern Sierra Madre, and R. sorsogonensis from southern Luzon and Catanduanes Island. Recent specimen collections, including the first adult specimen from the Cordillera Central, establish plumage differences between populations of R. rabori in the Cordillera Central and Sierra Madre and reveal a third diagnosable population within Luzon. These differences have gone unnoticed because R. rabori (sensu stricto) had been known only from the juvenile holotype. Molecular phylogenetic data further support the hypothesis that three highly divergent taxa occur across the Luzon Island complex: Robsonius rabori is known only from the northern Cordillera Central in Ilocos Norte; an undescribed taxon (formerly included in R. rabori) occurs in the northern Sierra Madre in Cagayan, Isabela, Aurora, and Nueva Vizcaya provinces; and R. sorsogonensis occurs in southern Luzon (Bulacan and Laguna provinces), the Bicol Peninsula, and on Catanduanes Island.

Habitat distribution (niche) models based on known occurrences provide geographical structure for such management as the environmental factors change. 2 Bark beetles play critical roles in coniferous forest dynamics in western North America. Among these insects, Dendroctonus rhizophagus Thomas and Bright, which occurs in the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico, is unique in that it attacks only immature trees (Pinus spp.) and therefore represents a threat to forest regeneration. We developed current habitat distribution models for D. rhizophagus and its Pinus hosts and projected these to future climate scenarios. 3 Predicted suitable habitat of D. rhizophagus currently covers approximately 119 000 km2 of which approximately 11% is occupied, and overlap with suitable habitat for all Pinus hosts exceeds 99.5%. Some suitable habitat occurs isolated from known D. rhizophagus occurrences in Mexico and the south-western U.S.A. 4 Habitat distribution models were projected to four potential climate scenarios for the period 2040\u20132060 and this predicted the gains and losses of suitable D. rhizophagus habitat throughout the region. Areas of north-western Mexico maintain large areas of suitable D. rhizophagus and Pinus host habitat in all scenarios. Dispersal to isolated areas of D. rhizophagus habitat appears unlikely. 5 The results of the present study can be used to target D. rhizophagus monitoring and management activities and may serve as a model for the management of other invasive species.","uuid":"190ede1d-80b5-35d6-ad3f-4738db47437a","authors":[{"forename":"Steven E.","surname":"Smith"},{"forename":"Ma.

Although there are no natural protected areas in Guerrero, it has suitable habitat for the jaguar, a common species used for planning and management of conservation areas. Since, there is actual evidence that environmental and anthropogenic variables may modify vertebrate species distribution with time, in this study we predicted the potential distribution of Panthera onca using MaxEnt for this Southeastern region. In addition, we made a projection considering the effect of a moderate climate change scenario, to evaluate the stability of the conservation area for a period of 24 years. Furthermore, we applied three threat scenarios for the actual prediction to define conservation priorities areas. In our results, we have found that 18 361Km2 (29%) of this state has a permanent suitable habitat for jaguar conservation in the Sierra Madre del Sur and Pacific coast, with a possible loss of 2 000km2 in 24 years. This habitat is characterized by a 56% of temperate forest (mainly conifers and hardwoods 34%), and 35% of tropical deciduous forest. With the projections, the Southeastern region resulted with the higher anthropogenic impacts, while at the same time, an area of 7 900km2 in the Central-Western state was determined as a priority for conservation. To assure jaguar conservation, we propose the inclusion of this new conservation area, which is located in the Sierra Madre del Sur, with which we may potentially preserve other 250 species of threatened vertebrates. This way, the suggested habitat conservation may represent a local effort in Guerrero and will strengthen the biological corridor network for P. onca protection in Latin America.","uuid":"ff141ca6-2b43-365f-ae5e-0e9532b82a8c","authors":[{"forename":"Angela P.","surname":"Cuervo-Robayo"},{"forename":"Octavio","surname":"Monroy-Vilchis"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Cuervo-Robayo"},{"id":"6016481374","title":"Potential distribution of American black bears in northwest Mexico and implications for their conservation","type":"Journal Article","volume":"23","issue":"1","url":"http:\/\/www.bioone.org\/doi\/abs\/10.2192\/URSUS-D-11-00007.1","tags":["2012","Aichi_C","conservation","GBIF_used","Mexico","Mexico_biodiversity","MX","species distribution","Target_12"],"keywords":["american black bear","distribution","ecological niche","mexico","sierra madre occidental","sky island"],"pages":"65-77","year":"2012","abstract":"Defining areas of potential distribution for large carnivores is a critical step for generating conservation strategies.

Our objective was to define areas and environmental factors that influence bear distribution and understand the causes of their absence. We used GARP (genetic algorithm for rule-set prediction) to define the potential area of distribution using historical and current records of black bear (n 5 582) and 23 bioclimatic and physical variables.

Information provided by residents of Aguascalientes, Chihuahua, Durango, and Zacatecas indicate that the species was extirpated in central and southwest Durango and Zacatecas about 50 years ago, coinciding with the use of 1080 poison (sodium fluoroacetate) to eradicate livestock predators, combined with habitat loss, fragmentation, and excessive hunting in the region. These factors precipitated the regional extirpation of the species.

Using seven DNA molecular markers, Bayesian inference is carried out to uncover sister species and to estimate time of divergence of the lineages. Ecological niche models are generated for four parapatric and sympatric sister species and two analyses of niche evolution are performed, one based on ecological niche models and another using raw data and multivariate analysis. As previous analyses suggest, the diversification of North America Ephedra species may be the result of a recent secondary radiation. Both parapatric and sympatric species diverged mostly in a scenario of climatic niche conservatism. However, we also found strong evidence for niche divergence for one of the sister species pairs (E. californica-E. trifurca). Moreover, the multivariate analysis found environmental differences for some variables between sister species. The estimated divergence time of three pairs of sister species distributed in southwestern North America (E. cutleri-E. aspera, E. californica-E. trifurca and E. torreyana-E. viridis) is inferred to have occurred in the Late Miocene to Pliocene and for the sister species pair E. antisyphilitica-E. coryi distributed in the southern United States and northeastern Mexico, it was inferred from the Pliocene to Pleistocene.

This is important because distribution is a key factor in the decision-making process for conservation. One example is the Bearded Wood Partridge Dendrortyx barbatus, a species endemic to the temperate forests of the Sierra Madre Oriental (SMO) mountain range in Mexico. Lack of knowledge of its distribution has generated confusion over the assignment of the correct risk category. With the aim of predicting the distribution area of the Bearded Wood Partridge and contributing to strategies for its conservation, we updated and extended the knowledge of its distribution by modelling its ecological niche using GARP and MaxEnt algorithms. We also analysed its environmental distribution using principal components analysis, and contrasted the two most important environmental variables with the species\u2019s distribution based on vegetation type. We found that the area potentially occupied by this species covers 17,956 km2 according to GARP and 12,974 km2 according to MaxEnt. We suggest that there is a biogeographic barrier which limits the distribution of this species in the southern part of its range. The abiotic variables that best explain its distribution are average annual precipitation and elevation, both of which coincide well with the distribution of cloud forest.

This is illustrated by the case of the Bearded Wood-Partridge (Dendrortyx barbatus), which is endemic to Mexico and was classified as threatened by the IUCN. Recently the discovery of this species in new locations caused an increase in the known distribution area whereupon it was reclassified in a lower risk category. In our study, delimitation and comparison of the Bearded Wood-Partridge distribution area is carried out utilising five different methods: minimum convex polygon; areographic; cartographic; ecological niche modeling; and, \u201cfree hand\u201d. A number of locality records are also used to demonstrate the chronological order of appearance. The results show that the size and shape of the distribution area of this species vary depending on the number of records and on their spatial and environmental location, as well as on the particular delimitation method used. However, ecological niche modeling provides the best results in terms of spatial and numerical sensitivity as well as lower values of omission and a moderate extent of predicted areas. We suggest that decisions related to species conservation (categories of risk, areas of endemism, etc.), particularly those species of high geographical restriction, should be contingent on the formalised delimitation of distribution areas based on ecological niche modeling methods.","uuid":"2f40c5c2-798e-3a22-9a45-e16dd5b2065b","authors":[{"forename":"Claudio","surname":"Mota-Vargas"},{"forename":"Octavio R.","surname":"Rojas-Soto"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Journal for Nature Conservation","firstAuthor":"Mota-Vargas"},{"id":"6016483744","title":"Patterns of species richness and biogeographic regionalization of the avifaunas of the seasonally dry tropical forest in Mesoamerica","type":"Journal Article","issue":"November 2012","url":"http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/01650521.2012.734175","tags":["2012","Aichi_E","birds","GBIF_used","GBIF_VIP","GBits_32","Meso America_biodiversity","Mexico","MX","Target_19"],"keywords":["biogeography","Mesoamerica","parsimony analysis of endemicity","seasonally dry tropical forests","species richness patterns"],"pages":"1-12","year":"2012","abstract":"Biogeographic patterns of avifaunas associated with seasonally dry tropical forests in Mesoamerica are poorly understood despite their high levels of species richness and endemism.

To date there have been few studies that have used recent field data to examine the status of populations of endangered salamanders. In this study we evaluate the current situation of two tiny salamanders, Parvimolge townsendi and Thorius pennatulus, both of which are distributed at intermediate elevations in the mountains of the northern Neotropics and are considered to be critically endangered; the first has been proposed as possibly extinct. By carrying out exhaustive surveys in both historical and potentially suitable sites for these two species, we evaluated their abundance and the characteristics of their habitats, and we estimated their potential geographic distribution. We visited 22 sites, investing 672 person-hours of sampling effort in the surveys, and found 201 P. townsendi salamanders in 11 sites and only 13 T. pennatulus salamanders in 5 sites. Both species were preferentially found in cloud forest fragments that were well conserved or only moderately transformed, and some of the salamanders were found in shade coffee plantations. The potential distribution area of both species is markedly fragmented and we estimate that it has decreased by more than 48%. The results of this study highlight the importance of carrying out exhaustive, systematic field surveys to obtain accurate information about the current situation of critically endangered species, and help us better understand the crisis that amphibians are facing worldwide.","uuid":"1270607f-416e-308b-a592-908fb4298a0e","authors":[{"forename":"Adriana","surname":"Sandoval-Comte"},{"forename":"Eduardo","surname":"Pineda"},{"forename":"Jos\u00e9 L.","surname":"Aguilar-L\u00f3pez"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"PLoS ONE","firstAuthor":"Sandoval-Comte"},{"id":"6016481534","title":"Modelling geographic patterns of population density of the white-tailed deer in central Mexico by implementing ecological niche theory","type":"Journal Article","volume":"online","issue":"March","url":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/j.1600-0706.2012.20350.x","tags":["2012","Aichi_E","conservation","GBIF_used","GBIF_VIP","in_press","Mexico","Mexico_biodiversity","MX","niche_modeling","SDM","species distribution","Target_19","university"],"keywords":[],"pages":"no-no","year":"2012","abstract":"Conservation and management of species require basic knowledge on their geographic distribution and abundance.

We used an ecological niche model to generate binary geographic distribution maps of the white-tailed deer in each region based on occurrence data and a set of environmental variables. Ten, the centroid of the distributions was calculated in ecological space (niche centroid) and the multidimensional Euclidian ecological distance of each pixel to the niche centroid was estimated. Finally, for each region the distance to the niche centroid (DNC) was regressed against 14 independent occurrence points in each site containing white-tailed deer density information to determine the function describing the DNC-density relationship, which was used to generate maps describing the distribution of white-tailed deer density. Our results indicated an inverse DNC-density relationship in both regions (Balsas Basin: r2 \ue035 0.90 and Tehuac\u00e1n- Cuicatl\u00e1n: r2 \ue035 0.76) that was validated via bootstrapping resulting in a predicting capacity of near 62% for Balsas Basin and 65% for Tehuac\u00e1n-Cuicatl\u00e1n Valley. Our results suggest that the distance to the niche centroid method is a robust, science-based correlative approach that resulted useful to predict the population density of the white-tailed deer in a spa- tially explicit fashion. Te proposed approach is suitable for predicting the distribution of density for white-tailed deer for which occurrence data with accompanying density information exists, but relative abundance can also be estimated when no abundance data are available.","uuid":"ebfcd910-8562-36db-a987-9f113a2d4a0e","authors":[{"forename":"Carlos","surname":"Ya\u00f1ez-Arenas"},{"forename":"Enrique","surname":"Mart\u00ednez-Meyer"},{"forename":"Salvador","surname":"Mandujano"},{"forename":"Octavio","surname":"Rojas-Soto"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Ya\u00f1ez-Arenas"},{"id":"6016482914","title":"Glucose inhibits the shoot bud formation in the moss Bryum billarderi","type":"Journal Article","volume":"7","issue":"4","url":"http:\/\/www.springerlink.com\/index\/10.2478\/s11535-012-0056-x","tags":["2012","Aichi_E","GBIF_used","Mexico","Mexico_biodiversity","MX","plants","species distribution","Target_19"],"keywords":["bryophyte developmental biology","bryum billarderi","bud formation","cytokinins","glucose","versita sp"],"pages":"648-654","year":"2012","abstract":"Plant development is controlled by certain factors such as nutrient availability, environmental cues and the presence of signalling molecules.

This glucose concentration also favoured the spread of the protonemal colony. These data demonstrate that N-6-benzylaminopurine is more effective than kinetin in inducing buds, and that glucose plays an important role as an inhibitory signalling molecule for the bud induction process that is mediated by cytokinins in the moss B. billarderi.","uuid":"e9c0d41e-2b97-3ac1-97ae-4a75839e597a","authors":[{"forename":"Arturo Mart\u00ednez","surname":"Zavala"},{"forename":"Netzahualcoyotl Mayek","surname":"P\u00e9rez"},{"forename":"Analilia Arroyo","surname":"Becerra"},{"forename":"Miguel Angel Villalobos","surname":"L\u00f3pez"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Central European Journal of Biology","firstAuthor":"Zavala"},{"id":"6016479004","title":"Licofitas (Equisetopsida : Lycopodiidae) de las Sierras Centrales de Argentina : un enfoque panbiogeogr\u00e1fico","type":"Journal Article","volume":"68","issue":"1","url":"http:\/\/www.scielo.cl\/pdf\/gbot\/v68n1\/art02.pdf","tags":["2011","AR","Argentina","conservation","GBIF_used","Mexico","museum","MX","Spanish","university"],"keywords":["Biogeography","Chaco serrano","Iso\u00ebtaceae","Lycopodiaceae","Selaginellaceae"],"pages":"16-22","year":"2011","abstract":"Lycophytes (Equisetopsida: Lycopodiidae) from the Central Hills of Argentina: a panbiogeographic approach.

Furthermore, 13% of the suitable areas are included in existing PAs and 14% are included in JCUs (Sanderson et al., 2002). Main conclusions Clearly much more should be carried out to establish a proactive conservation strategy. Based on our results, we propose here new jaguar conservation and management areas that are important for a nationwide conservation blueprint.","uuid":"85e3601c-8d08-3bd0-9915-9d1215f800db","authors":[{"forename":"Clarita","surname":"Rodr\u00edguez-Soto"},{"forename":"Octavio","surname":"Monroy-Vilchis"},{"forename":"Luigi","surname":"Maiorano"},{"forename":"Luigi","surname":"Boitani"},{"forename":"Juan Carlos","surname":"Faller"},{"forename":"Miguel \u00c1.","surname":"Briones"},{"forename":"Rodrigo","surname":"N\u00fa\u00f1ez"},{"forename":"Octavio","surname":"Rosas-Rosas"},{"forename":"Gerardo","surname":"Ceballos"},{"forename":"Alessandra","surname":"Falcucci"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Diversity and Distributions","firstAuthor":"Rodr\u00edguez-Soto"},{"id":"6016480114","title":"Two New Species of Urochloa (Paniceae; Panicoideae; Poaceae) from Western Mexico and the Updated Checklist with a Key to Species of the Genus in Mexico","type":"Journal Article","volume":"36","issue":"3","url":"http:\/\/openurl.ingenta.com\/content\/xref?genre=article&issn=0363-6445&volume=36&issue=3&spage=621\nhttp:\/\/www.bioone.org\/doi\/full\/10.1600\/036364411X583619","tags":["2011","checklist","GBIF_used","Mexico","MX","taxonomy","university"],"keywords":["Fertile floret micromorphology","Paniceae","U. olivacea","U. pauciflora","Urochloa","western Mexico"],"pages":"621-630","year":"2011","abstract":"Two new species from western Mexico, Urochloa olivacea and U. pauciflora (Paniceae; Panicoideae; Poaceae) are described and illustrated here.

We used historical and current field records along with climatic and topographic variables to generate three different models (Biomapper, Maxent, and GARP). Using field data on species occurrence, a model was selected based on the accuracy of assessment results. A final model was obtained by eliminating those areas mapped as known unsuitable habitat, using high resolution land use\/land cover data. The GARP model obtained the best accuracy values. It showed the winter distribution of the Black-capped Vireo to cover an area in western Mexico of about 141,000 km2 that runs along the Pacific coast from southern Sonora (R\u00edo Yaqui, Alvaro Obreg\u00f3n Dam) to the southern state of Oaxaca (Salina Cruz on the Pacific coast and Matias Romero, and inland). One third of the proposed model\u2019s area was located at elevations of 0\u2013500 m, while 83% occurred at elevations < 1,250 m; however, a significant area (17%) consists of sites > 1,250 m in elevation. For the most part, the distribution model proposed closely followed the tropical dry forest boundaries and clearly avoided temperate areas at higher elevations. This situation seems to be critical for the species, since the dry forest is one of most endangered Neotropical ecosystems, both nationally and internationally. Furthermore, the array of areas under protection regimes included only about 7.1% of the predicted wintering area. However, this figure could be misleading when it is considered that some protected areas are just \u201cpaper reserves\u201d without significant conservation programmes developed in situ.","uuid":"148778ed-6e95-3946-9e65-95fd2c22db03","authors":[{"forename":"Jorge H.","surname":"Vega Rivera"},{"forename":"Miguel A.","surname":"Ortega-Huerta"},{"forename":"Sahotra","surname":"Sarkar"},{"forename":"John H.","surname":"Rappole"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Vega Rivera"},{"id":"6016479794","title":"Potential distribution of Mexican primates: modeling the ecological niche with the maximum entropy algorithm.","type":"Journal Article","volume":"52","issue":"3","url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21404094","tags":["2011","biogeography","distribution","ecology","GBIF_used","IUCN Red List","mammals","Mexico","MX","niche_modeling","SDM"],"keywords":["Alouatta palliata","alouatta pigra","Ateles geoffroyi","ecological niche modeling","MaxEnt","potential distribution"],"pages":"261-270","year":"2011","abstract":"We developed a potential distribution model for the tropical rain forest species of primates of southern Mexico: the black howler monkey (Alouatta pigra), the mantled howler monkey (Alouatta palliata), and the spider monkey (Ateles geoffroyi).

For each species, we used occurrence records from scientific collections, and published and unpublished sources, and we also used the 19 environmental coverage variables related to precipitation and temperature from WorldClim to develop the models. The predicted distribution of A. pigra was strongly associated with the mean temperature of the warmest quarter (23.6%), whereas the potential distributions of A. palliata and A. geoffroyi were strongly associated with precipitation during the coldest quarter (52.2 and 34.3% respectively). The potential distribution of A. geoffroyi is broader than that of the Alouatta spp. The areas with the greatest probability of presence of A. pigra and A. palliata are strongly associated with riparian vegetation, whereas the presence of A. geoffroyi is more strongly associated with the presence of rain forest. Our most significant contribution is the identification of areas with a high probability of the presence of these primate species, which is information that can be applied to planning future studies and then establishing criteria for the creation of areas to primate conservation in Mexico.","uuid":"acda7db7-44e1-3735-a5d8-60af4fef2a7d","authors":[{"forename":"Francisca","surname":"Vidal-Garc\u00eda"},{"forename":"Juan Carlos","surname":"Serio-Silva"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Primates; journal of primatology","firstAuthor":"Vidal-Garc\u00eda"},{"id":"6016480154","title":"Assessing conservation values: biodiversity and endemicity in tropical land use systems.","type":"Journal Article","volume":"6","issue":"1","url":"http:\/\/www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov\/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3029302&tool=pmcentrez&rendertype=abstract","tags":["2011","Cameroon","CM","conservation","DE","GBIF_used","Germany","Mexico","MX","university"],"keywords":[],"pages":"e16238","year":"2011","abstract":"Despite an increasing amount of data on the effects of tropical land use on continental forest fauna and flora, it is debatable whether the choice of the indicator variables allows for a proper evaluation of the role of modified habitats in mitigating the global biodiversity crisis. While many single-taxon studies have highlighted that species with narrow geographic ranges especially suffer from habitat modification, there is no multi-taxa study available which consistently focuses on geographic range composition of the studied indicator groups. We compiled geographic range data for 180 bird, 119 butterfly, 204 tree and 219 understorey plant species sampled along a gradient of habitat modification ranging from near-primary forest through young secondary forest and agroforestry systems to annual crops in the southwestern lowlands of Cameroon. We found very similar patterns of declining species richness with increasing habitat modification between taxon-specific groups of similar geographic range categories. At the 8 km(2) spatial level, estimated richness of endemic species declined in all groups by 21% (birds) to 91% (trees) from forests to annual crops, while estimated richness of widespread species increased by +101% (trees) to +275% (understorey plants), or remained stable (-2%, butterflies). Even traditional agroforestry systems lost estimated endemic species richness by -18% (birds) to -90% (understorey plants). Endemic species richness of one taxon explained between 37% and 57% of others (positive correlations) and taxon-specific richness in widespread species explained up to 76% of variation in richness of endemic species (negative correlations). The key implication of this study is that the range size aspect is fundamental in assessments of conservation value via species inventory data from modified habitats. The study also suggests that even ecologically friendly agricultural matrices may be of much lower value for tropical conservation than indicated by mere biodiversity value.","uuid":"385e6ef0-b46c-3116-8bdf-7f0257e34d17","authors":[{"forename":"Matthias","surname":"Waltert"},{"forename":"Kadiri Serge","surname":"Bobo"},{"forename":"Stefanie","surname":"Kaupa"},{"forename":"Marcela Leija","surname":"Montoya"},{"forename":"Moses Sainge","surname":"Nsanyi"},{"forename":"Heleen","surname":"Fermon"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"PloS one","firstAuthor":"Waltert"},{"id":"6016475494","title":"Benzophenones from the roots of the Popoluca Amerindian medicinal plant Securidaca diversifolia (L.)

Evaluating the distribution of species richness where biodiversity is high but has been insufficiently sampled is not an easy task. Species distribution modelling has become a useful approach for predicting their ranges, based on the relationships between species records and environmental variables. Overlapping predictions of individual distributions could be a useful strategy for obtaining estimates of species richness and composition in a region, but these estimates should be evaluated using a proper validation process, which compares the predicted richness values and composition with accurate data from independent sources. 2. In this study, we propose a simple approach to estimate model performance for several distributional predictions generated simultaneously. This approach is particularly suitable when species distribution modelling techniques that require only presence data are used. 3. The individual distributions for the 370 known amphibian species of Mexico were predicted using maxent to model data on their known presence (66,113 presence-only records). Distributions were subsequently overlapped to obtain a prediction of species richness. Accuracy was assessed by comparing the overall species richness values predicted for the region with observed and predicted values from 118 well-surveyed sites, each with an area of c. 100 km(2), which were identified using species accumulation curves and nonparametric estimators. 4. The derived models revealed a remarkable heterogeneity of species richness across the country, provided information about species composition per site and allowed us to obtain a measure of the spatial distribution of prediction errors. Examining the magnitude and location of model inaccuracies, as well as separately assessing errors of both commission and omission, highlights the inaccuracy of the predictions of species distribution models and the need to provide measures of uncertainty along with the model results. 5. The combination of a species distribution modelling method like maxent and species richness estimators offers a useful tool for identifying when the overall pattern provided by all model predictions might be representing the geographical patterns of species richness and composition, regardless of the particular quality or accuracy of the predictions for each individual species.","uuid":"06628f07-3118-391d-8818-362b1eb7a386","authors":[{"forename":"Eduardo","surname":"Pineda"},{"forename":"Jorge M","surname":"Lobo"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"The Journal of animal ecology","firstAuthor":"Pineda"}]
