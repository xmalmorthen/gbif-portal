There was close concordance between the model\u2019s projection of suitable climate and recorded observations of the species. The projection was highly sensitive to irrigation; the area of potentially suitable land globally increasing by 30% (from 34 to 45 million km2) under current climate when a \u2018\u2018top-up\u2019\u2019 irrigation regime (rainfall topped up 4 mm d21 on irrigable land), was included in the model. Most of the area that becomes suitable under irrigation is located in central Asia and central North America. By contrast, climate change is projected to have the opposite effect; the potential global distribution diminishing by 18% (from 34 to 28 million km2). This range contraction was the net result of a northward expansion in the northern limit for the species in Canada and the Russian Federation, and a relatively larger increase in the land area becoming unsuitable mainly in central Asia and south eastern United States.","uuid":"4acaf1f4-476d-3c3f-b518-921120aff548","authors":[{"forename":"Graeme W.","surname":"Bourd\u00f4t"},{"forename":"Shona L.","surname":"Lamoureaux"},{"forename":"Michael S.","surname":"Watt"},{"forename":"Darren J.","surname":"Kriticos"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Weed Science","firstAuthor":"Bourd\u00f4t"},{"id":"6016483514","title":"Ancient DNA reveals that bowhead whale lineages survived Late Pleistocene climate change and habitat shifts","type":"Journal Article","volume":"4","url":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/ncomms2714","tags":["2013","Aichi_E","AU","Australia","DE","Denmark","DK","GB","GBIF_used","GBits_8","Germany","Netherlands","NL","SE","Sweden","Target_19"],"keywords":[],"pages":"1677","year":"2013","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","abstract":"The climatic changes of the glacial cycles are thought to have been a major driver of population declines and species extinctions.

However, few studies have determined the mechanisms underlying lag phases. Such a mechanistic understanding is vital if the potential ecosystem-level impacts are to be predicted and the invasion risks to be managed proactively. Here we examine Banksia ericifolia, introduced for floriculture to South Africa, as a case study. We found 18 sites where the species has been planted, with self-sustaining (naturalized) populations at four sites, and an invasive population at one site. The invasion originated from around 100 individuals planted 35 years ago; after several fires this population has grown to approximately 10 000 plants covering about 127 ha. The current invasion of B. ericifolia already has ecosystem-level impacts, for example the nectar available to bird pollinators has more than doubled, potentially disrupting native pollination networks. If fires occurred at the other naturalized sites we anticipate populations would rapidly spread and densify with invaded areas ultimately become banksia-dominated woodlands. Indeed the only site other than the invasive site where fire has occurred regularly is already showing signs of rapid population growth and spread. However, recruitment is mainly immediately post fire and no seed bank accumulates in the soil, mechanical control of adult plants is cheap and effective, and immature plants are easily detected. This study is a first in illustrating the importance of fire in driving lag phases and provides a valuable example for why it is essential to determine the mechanisms that mediate lag phases in introduced plant species. Serotinous species that have been introduced to areas where fire is suppressed could easily be misinterpreted as low risk species whilst they remain in a lag phase, but they can represent a major invasion risk.","uuid":"d97b69a9-dea2-3383-9ae9-8fe696403f24","authors":[{"forename":"Sjirk","surname":"Geerts"},{"forename":"Desika","surname":"Moodley"},{"forename":"Mirijam","surname":"Gaertner"},{"forename":"Johannes J.","surname":"Le Roux"},{"forename":"Melodie A.","surname":"McGeoch"},{"forename":"Cedric","surname":"Muofhe"},{"forename":"David M.","surname":"Richardson"},{"forename":"John R.

Since prevention is the most cost-effective way to avoid biodiversity loss and ecosystem problems, one challenge in ecological research is to understand the limits of the fundamental niche of the species in order to estimate how far invasive species could spread. Trichocorixa verticalis verticalis (Tvv) is a corixid (Hemiptera) originally distributed in North America, but cited as an alien species in three continents. Its impact on native communities is under study, but it is already the dominant species in several saline wetlands and represents a rare example of an aquatic alien insect. This study aims: i) to estimate areas with suitable environmental conditions for Tvv at a global scale, thus identifying potential new zones of invasion; and ii) to test possible changes in this global potential distribution under a climate change scenario. Potential distributions were estimated by applying a multidimensional envelope procedure based on both climatic data, obtained from observed occurrences, and thermal physiological data. Our results suggest Tvv may expand well beyond its current range and find inhabitable conditions in temperate areas along a wide range of latitudes, with an emphasis on coastal areas of Europe, Northern Africa, Argentina, Uruguay, Australia, New Zealand, Myanmar, India, the western boundary between USA and Canada, and areas of the Arabian Peninsula. When considering a future climatic scenario, the suitability area of Tvv showed only limited changes compared with the current potential distribution. These results allow detection of potential contact zones among currently colonized areas and potential areas of invasion. We also identified zones with a high level of suitability that overlap with areas recognized as global hotspots of biodiversity. Finally, we present hypotheses about possible means of spread, focusing on different geographical scales.","uuid":"74c6b38e-860e-353b-ba0a-b2921ed31e62","authors":[{"forename":"Simone","surname":"Guareschi"},{"forename":"Cristina","surname":"Coccia"},{"forename":"David","surname":"S\u00e1nchez-Fern\u00e1ndez"},{"forename":"Jos\u00e9 Antonio","surname":"Carbonell"},{"forename":"Josefa","surname":"Velasco"},{"forename":"Luz","surname":"Boyero"},{"forename":"Andy J.","surname":"Green"},{"forename":"Andr\u00e9s","surname":"Mill\u00e1n"}],"editors":[{"forename":"Matteo","surname":"Convertino"}],"publication_outlet":"PLoS ONE","firstAuthor":"Guareschi"},{"id":"6016484664","title":"Climate change impact on seaweed meadow distribution in the North Atlantic rocky intertidal","type":"Journal Article","url":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1002\/ece3.541","tags":["2013","Aichi_B","AU","Australia","BE","Belgium","GBIF_used","GBits_8","in_press","marine","Maxent","Netherlands","NL","NO","North Atlantic_biodiversity","Norway","SDM","Target_10","US"],"keywords":["ascophyllum","ecological niche models","fucus","geographic distribution","global warming","intertidal","macroalgae","species distribution"],"year":"2013","abstract":"The North-Atlantic has warmed faster than all other ocean basins and climate change scenarios predict sea surface temperature isotherms to shift up to 600 km northwards by the end of the 21st century.

We asked the question: Where will climate change have the greatest impact on three foundational, macroalgal species that occur along North-Atlantic shores: Fucus serratus, Fucus vesiculosus, and Ascophyllum nodo- sum? To predict distributional changes of these key species under three IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) climate change scenarios (A2, A1B, and B1) over the coming two centuries, we generated Ecological Niche Models with the program MAXENT.

In considering this paradox it is important to understand that benefits and threats may not always be apparent in equal measure throughout the potential range of each candidate biofuel species. In some environments, a species could potentially produce valuable biological materials without posing a significant invasion threat. In this study, we develop a bioclimatic niche model for a candidate biofuel crop, Millettia pinnata, and apply the model to different climatic and irrigation scenarios to estimate the current and future patterns of climate suitability for its growth and naturalization. We use Australia as a case study for interpreting the niche model in terms that may be informative for both biofuels proponents and biosecurity regulators to plan management programmes that reflect the invasive potential in different areas. The model suggests that suitable growing conditions for M. pinnata in Australia are naturally restricted to the moist and semimoist tropics. Irriga- tion can extend the suitable growing conditions more widely throughout the tropics, and into more arid regions. Under future climate scenarios, suitable growing conditions for M. pinnata under natural rainfall contract towards the east coast, and extend southward into the subtropics. With irrigation, M. pinnata appears to have the potential in the future to naturalize across much of Australia. The bioclimatic modelling method demon- strated here is comparatively quick and easy, and can produce a rich array of data products to inform the inter- ests of both bioenergy proponents and biosecurity regulators. We show how this modelling can support the development of spatially explicit biosecurity policies designed to manage invasion risks in a manner that balances bioenergy and biosecurity concerns.","uuid":"28907a1e-83c8-3b75-b60d-54b8a98029a7","authors":[{"forename":"D.

A recently described eriophyid mite, Aceria thalgi from Sonchus species found in southern Australia,was assessed for its potential as a biological control agent for these weeds. Glasshouse host range testing and field observations of 11 species from seven genera from the Lactuceae tribe of Asteraceae showed that A. thalgi survived only on plants within the Sonchinae subtribe (S. asper, S. oleraceus and S. hydrophilus) and not on the closely related Actites megalocarpus, Reichardia tingitana or other test plants. Under glasshouse conditions and varying plant ages, A. thalgi infestation caused significant growth reduction of the exotic species S. oleraceus (up to 97%) and, to a lesser extent, the Australian native S. hydrophilus (up to 33%). Six temperatures from 9.1 to 33.7\u00b0C were used to determine population growth parameters for A. thalgi. The range of temperatures suitable for population growth was used to modify a CLIMEX model based on its host S. oleraceus. The projected world distribution of the CLIMEX model indicates that the mite could establish in some areas of North America, making it a possibility for an augmentative approach to biological control of Sonchus spp. in that region. The model confirms the potential for a widespread distribution of A. thalgi in southern Australia where it could be considered for a conservative approach to biological control of Sonchus spp. in cropping systems.","uuid":"bfc71cc1-4836-3441-9fad-e20453647d78","authors":[{"forename":"Kathryn L.","surname":"McCarren"},{"forename":"John K.","surname":"Scott"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Australian Journal of Entomology","firstAuthor":"McCarren"},{"id":"6016484174","title":"A specialist\u2019s audit of aggregated occurrence records","type":"Journal Article","volume":"293","url":"http:\/\/www.pensoft.net\/journals\/zookeys\/article\/5111\/abstract\/a-specialist","tags":["2013","AU","Australia","Australia_biodiversity","GBIF_primary","GBIF_used","GBIF_VIP","GBits_8"],"keywords":["ala","australia","data cleaning","data quality","diplopoda","gbif","millipede","occurrence records"],"pages":"1-18","year":"2013","uuid":"39efe81d-9377-3d09-8ff6-6ac55a89818f","authors":[{"forename":"Robert","surname":"Mesibov"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"ZooKeys","firstAuthor":"Mesibov"},{"id":"6016483174","title":"Niche conservatism constrains Australian honeyeater assemblages in stressful environments","type":"Journal Article","url":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/ele.12156","tags":["2013","Aichi_E","AU","Australia","Australia_biodiversity","GBIF_used","GBIF_VIP","GBits_9","in_press","Target_19","US"],"keywords":["Arid zone","Australia","biodiversity gradients","community assembly","Meliphagidae","phyloclimatespace","phyloge- netic clustering","phylogenetic niche conservatism","phylogenetic structure","range size"],"year":"2013","abstract":"The hypothesis of phylogenetic niche conservatism proposes that most extant members of a clade remain in ancestral environments because expansion into new ecological space imposes a selectional load on a popula- tion.

Although the role of species diversity in the maintenance of ecosystem processes has been widely investigated, the role of rare species remains controversial. A critical issue is whether common species insure against the loss of functions supported by rare species. This issue is even more critical in species-rich ecosystems where high functional redundancy among species is likely and where it is thus often assumed that ecosystem functioning is buffered against species loss. Here, using extensive datasets of species occurrences and functional traits from three highly diverse ecosystems (846 coral reef fishes, 2,979 alpine plants, and 662 tropical trees), we demonstrate that the most distinct combinations of traits are supported predominantly by rare species both in terms of local abundance and regional occupancy. Moreover, species that have low functional redundancy and are likely to support the most vulnerable functions, with no other species carrying similar combinations of traits, are rarer than expected by chance in all three ecosystems. For instance, 63% and 98% of fish species that are likely to support highly vulnerable functions in coral reef ecosystems are locally and regionally rare, respectively. For alpine plants, 32% and 89% of such species are locally and regionally rare, respectively. Remarkably, 47% of fish species and 55% of tropical tree species that are likely to support highly vulnerable functions have only one individual per sample on average. Our results emphasize the importance of rare species conservation, even in highly diverse ecosystems, which are thought to exhibit high functional redundancy. Rare species offer more than aesthetic, cultural, or taxonomic diversity value; they disproportionately increase the potential breadth of functions provided by ecosystems across spatial scales. As such, they are likely to insure against future uncertainty arising from climate change and the ever-increasing anthropogenic pressures on ecosystems. Our results call for a more detailed understanding of the role of rarity and functional vulnerability in ecosystem functioning.","uuid":"16e05535-cd17-3ef8-9e1b-9b4b89669e51","authors":[{"forename":"David","surname":"Mouillot"},{"forename":"David R.","surname":"Bellwood"},{"forename":"Christopher","surname":"Baraloto"},{"forename":"Jerome","surname":"Chave"},{"forename":"Rene","surname":"Galzin"},{"forename":"Mireille","surname":"Harmelin-Vivien"},{"forename":"Michel","surname":"Kulbicki"},{"forename":"Sebastien","surname":"Lavergne"},{"forename":"Sandra","surname":"Lavorel"},{"forename":"Nicolas","surname":"Mouquet"},{"forename":"C.

After accounting for taxonomy and variability in parameter estimates among species using variance-weighted linear mixed effects modelling, temperature sensitivity of SMR had an activation energy (Ea) of 0.16 for both Northern and Southern Hemisphere species which was lower than predicted under the metabolic theory of ecology (Ea 0.2-1.2 eV). Northern Hemisphere species, however, had a higher SMR at each habitat temperature, but a lower mass-scaling exponent relative to SMR. Evolutionary trade-offs that may be driving differences in metabolic rate (such as metabolic cold adaptation of Northern Hemisphere species) will have important impacts on species abilities to respond to changing environments.","uuid":"194e4898-d387-38cc-ae67-3f371e02a79a","authors":[{"forename":"Sue-Ann","surname":"Watson"},{"forename":"Simon A.","surname":"Morley"},{"forename":"Amanda E.","surname":"Bates"},{"forename":"Melody S.","surname":"Clark"},{"forename":"Robert W.","surname":"Day"},{"forename":"Miles","surname":"Lamare"},{"forename":"Stephanie M.","surname":"Martin"},{"forename":"Paul C.","surname":"Southgate"},{"forename":"Koh Siang","surname":"Tan"},{"forename":"Paul A.","surname":"Tyler"},{"forename":"Lloyd S.","surname":"Peck"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Watson"},{"id":"6016482034","title":"Potential Distribution and Risk Assessment of an Invasive Plant Species: A Case Study of Hymenachne amplexicaulis in Australia","type":"Journal Article","volume":"19","issue":"1","url":"http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/10807039.2012.632293","tags":["2013","Aichi_B","AU","Australia","Australia_biodiversity","GBIF_used","GBits_32","global_biodiversity","invasive","plants","Target_9"],"notes":"GBIF data was  not used for Australia.","keywords":[],"pages":"53-79","year":"2013","abstract":"Given the limited resources available for weed management, a strategic approach is required to give the \u201cbest bang for your buck.\u201d The current study incorporates: (1) a model ensemble approach to identify areas of uncertainty and commonal- ity regarding a species invasive potential, (2) current distribution of the invaded species, and (3) connectivity of systems to identify target regions and focus efforts for more effective management.

There are severalmethods available to estimate species distribution and the effect of using them is not clearly understood. In this research, we assess the effect of species distributions derived from four geographical distribu- tion estimation methods on derived species richness and phylogenetic diversity (PD). We used the following four most common approaches to determine species geograph- ical distributions: (1) range-wide occurrences are records of presence from databases and museum collections; (2) marginal occurrences are generally expert drawn distri- butional maps; (3) species distribution modeling (SDM) combines geographic records and environmental data to predict species occurrence; and (4) a combined approach that constrains the statistical modeling predictions by themarginal occurrence distributions. Using these approaches, we estimated richness and PD and their correspondent geo- graphic hotspots for three different analysis resolutions using non-overlapping square windows of 2\u25e6,4\u25e6,and 6\u25e6 across Australia. We also assessed the differences of the resultant geographical distributions for three different spatial resolutions. We found markedly different hotspots when using range-wide occurrences and statistical model- ing approaches. Range-wide occurrences resulted in low values of species richness and PD and statistical modeling resulted in high values. The combined and marginal occur- rences approaches both had intermediate values, with the combined approach showing a finer level of detail than the marginal occurrences. There is a tendency for species range sizes between methods to converge with decreasing spatial resolution. Even for a relatively well-sampled group such as the Australian marsupials, the range-wide occur- rences approach is likely to underestimate the presence of species. Conversely, because SDMs usually do not account for dispersal abilities or biotic interactions, it is likely that species geographical distributions using this approach are overestimated. Depending on the method used, the resultant estimates of diversity may be completely different. Caution is needed when choosing the method to estimate species distribution.","uuid":"c6389153-5615-318b-9ab7-6ae418768c63","authors":[{"forename":"Mayra P.M.","surname":"Amboni"},{"forename":"Shawn W.","surname":"Laffan"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"International Journal of Geographical Information Science","firstAuthor":"Amboni"},{"id":"6016484864","title":"Leaf evolution in Southern Hemisphere conifers tracks the angiosperm ecological radiation.","type":"Journal Article","volume":"279","issue":"1727","url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21653584\nhttp:\/\/rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org\/content\/279\/1727\/341","tags":["2012","AU","Australia","ecology","GB","GBIF_used","Global_biodiversity","university"],"keywords":["divergence time estimates","molecular phylogeny","plant evolution","Podocarpaceae"],"pages":"314-348","year":"2012","abstract":"The angiosperm radiation has been linked to sharp declines in gymnosperm diversity and the virtual elimination of conifers from the tropics. The conifer family Podocarpaceae stands as an exception with highest species diversity in wet equatorial forests. It has been hypothesized that efficient light harvesting by the highly flattened leaves of several podocarp genera facilitates persistence with canopy-forming angiosperms, and the angiosperm ecological radiation may have preferentially favoured the diversification of these lineages. To test these ideas, we develop a molecular phylogeny for Podocarpaceae using Bayesian-relaxed clock methods incorporating fossil time constraints. We find several independent origins of flattened foliage types, and that these lineages have diversified predominantly through the Cenozoic and therefore among canopy-forming angiosperms. The onset of sustained foliage flattening podocarp diversification is coincident with a declining diversification rate of scale\/needle-leaved lineages and also with ecological and climatic transformations linked to angiosperm foliar evolution. We demonstrate that climatic range evolution is contingent on the underlying state for leaf morphology. Taken together, our findings imply that as angiosperms came to dominate most terrestrial ecosystems, competitive interactions at the foliar level have profoundly shaped podocarp geography and as a consequence, rates of lineage diversification.","uuid":"a08f36f2-daeb-3eaf-bdda-7d69853ad11d","authors":[{"forename":"Ed","surname":"Biffin"},{"forename":"Timothy J.","surname":"Brodribb"},{"forename":"Robert S.","surname":"Hill"},{"forename":"Philip","surname":"Thomas"},{"forename":"Andrew J.","surname":"Lowe"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Biffin"},{"id":"6016482364","title":"The potential global distribution of the invasive weed Nassella neesiana under current and future climates","type":"Journal Article","volume":"14","issue":"8","url":"http:\/\/www.springerlink.com\/index\/10.1007\/s10530-010-9905-6","tags":["2012","Aichi_B","AU","Australia","CSIRO","GBIF_used","global_biodiversity","invasive","New Zealand","NZ","Target_9"],"keywords":["Animal health","Chilean needle grass","Climate change","CLIMEX","Stipa neesiana","Weed invasion"],"pages":"1545-1556","year":"2012","abstract":"Nassella neesiana (Trin. and Rupr.)

As a first step towards a global risk analysis we project a CLIMEX model of N. neesiana distribution globally under current climate and six future climate scenarios. Under current climate, areas not yet invaded, but climatically suitable, are eastern and south-western Africa, the north-west coast and south-eastern USA in North America, high-elevation areas in Central America, south-eastern China, northern Africa along the Mediterranean Sea, parts of Nepal, India and Pakistan, and Europe. Under the future climate scenarios, a mean global reduction of 32% in the area of suitable climate is projected, with marked reductions in the native range (34%) and also in Africa (67%), Asia (30%), North America (36%), and Australia (42%). These range contractions are primarily attributable to projected increases in temperatures leading to lethal heat stress excluding the plant from areas currently designated as sub-tropical and tropical humid. By contrast, projected expansions eastward in Europe and westward in New Zealand, result in increases in suitable area of 70 and 60%, respectively. Based on these results, which were consistent across the climate-change scenarios, the countries most at risk from N. neesiana are located in western and eastern Europe.

Such a containment strategy would require controls to limit human-assisted dispersal of the species\u2019 fruit and to ban the species from propagation and distribution throughout Europe.","uuid":"17a56121-1746-3877-aa48-ccd5b6b18ba1","authors":[{"forename":"Graeme W.","surname":"Bourd\u00f4t"},{"forename":"Shona L.","surname":"Lamoureaux"},{"forename":"Michael S.","surname":"Watt"},{"forename":"Lucy K.","surname":"Manning"},{"forename":"Darren J.","surname":"Kriticos"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Biological Invasions","firstAuthor":"Bourd\u00f4t"},{"id":"6016483764","title":"Three new species allied to the \u2018Mirbelia viminalis group\u2019 (Fabaceae: Mirbelieae), from Western Australia","type":"Journal Article","volume":"22","issue":"2","url":"http:\/\/florabase.dec.wa.gov.au\/science\/nuytsia\/636.pdf","tags":["2012","Aichi_E","AU","Australia","Australia_biodiversity","GBIF_used","herbarium","Target_19","taxonomy"],"keywords":[],"pages":"75-92","year":"2012","abstract":"Three new species allied to the \u2018Mirbelia viminalis group\u2019 (Fabaceae: Mirbelieae), from Western Australia.

A possible explanation for this pattern is that the narrow thermal tolerances of tropical species and greater climatic stratification of tropical mountains create more opportunities for climate-associated parapatric or allopatric speciation in the tropics relative to the temperate zone. However, it is unclear whether a general relationship exists among latitude, climatic zonation and the ecology of speciation. Recent taxon-specific studies obtained different results regarding the role of climate in speciation in tropical versus temperate areas. Here, we quantify overlap in the climatic distributions of 93 pairs of sister species of mammals, birds, amphibians and reptiles restricted to either the New World tropics or to the Northern temperate zone. We show that elevational ranges of tropical- and temperate-zone species do not differ from one another, yet the temperature range experienced by species in the temperate zone is greater than for those in the tropics. Moreover, tropical sister species tend to exhibit greater similarity in their climatic distributions than temperate sister species. This pattern suggests that evolutionary conservatism in the thermal niches of tropical taxa, coupled with the greater thermal zonation of tropical mountains, may result in increased opportunities for allopatric isolation, speciation and the accumulation of species in tropical montane regions. Our study exemplifies the power of combining phylogenetic and spatial datasets of global climatic variation to explore evolutionary (rather than purely ecological) explanations for the high biodiversity of tropical montane regions.","uuid":"3cbc26c3-f118-3b8a-9b77-f3e24c5799e5","authors":[{"forename":"Carlos Daniel","surname":"Cadena"},{"forename":"Kenneth H.","surname":"Kozak"},{"forename":"Juan Pablo","surname":"G\u00f3mez"},{"forename":"Juan Luis","surname":"Parra"},{"forename":"Christy M.","surname":"McCain"},{"forename":"Rauri C.

National statistics were used to estimate current annual production from agricultural and forest production systems. Crop residues were estimated from grain production and harvest index. Wood production statistics and spatial modelling of forest growth were used to estimate quantities of pulpwood, in-forest residues, and wood processing residues. Possible new production systems for oil from algae and the oil-seed tree Pongamia pinnata, and of lignocellulosic biomass production from short-rotation coppiced eucalypt crops were also examined. The following constraints were applied to biomass production and use: avoiding clearing of native vegetation; minimizing impacts on domestic food security; retaining a portion of agricultural and forest residues to protect soil; and minimizing the impact on local processing industries by diverting only the export fraction of grains or pulpwood to bioenergy. We estimated that it would be physically possible to produce 9.6 GL yr\u22121 of first generation ethanol from current production systems, replacing 6.5 GL yr\u22121 of gasoline or 34% of current gasoline usage. Current production systems for waste oil, tallow and canola seed could produce 0.9 GL yr\u22121 of biodiesel, or 4% of current diesel usage. Cellulosic biomass from current agricultural and forestry production systems (including biomass from hardwood plantations maturing by 2030) could produce 9.5 GL yr\u22121 of ethanol, replacing 6.4 GL yr\u22121 of gasoline, or ca. 34% of current consumption. The same lignocellulosic sources could instead provide 35 TWh yr\u22121, or ca. 15% of current electricity production. New production systems using algae and P. pinnata could produce ca. 3.96 and 0.9 GL biodiesel yr\u22121, respectively. In combination, they could replace 4.2 GL yr\u22121 of fossil diesel, or 23% of current usage. Short-rotation coppiced eucalypt crops could provide 4.3 GL yr\u22121 of ethanol (2.9 GL yr\u22121 replacement, or 15% of current gasoline use) or 20.2 TWh yr\u22121 of electricity (9% of current generation). In total, first and second generation fuels from current and new production systems could mitigate 26 Mt CO2-e, which is 38% of road transport emissions and 5% of the national emissions. Second generation fuels from current and new production systems could mitigate 13 Mt CO2-e, which is 19% of road transport emissions and 2.4% of the national emissions lignocellulose from current and new production systems could mitigate 48 Mt CO2-e, which is 28% of electricity emissions and 9% of the national emissions. There are challenging sustainability issues to consider in the production of large amounts of feedstock for bioenergy in Australia. Bioenergy production can have either positive or negative impacts. Although only the export fraction of grains and sugar was used to estimate first generation biofuels so that domestic food security was not affected, it would have an impact on food supply elsewhere. Environmental impacts on soil, water and biodiversity can be significant because of the large land base involved, and the likely use of intensive harvest regimes. These require careful management. Social impacts could be significant if there were to be large-scale change in land use or management. In addition, although the economic considerations of feedstock production were not covered in this article, they will be the ultimate drivers of industry development. They are uncertain and are highly dependent on government policies (e.g. the price on carbon, GHG mitigation and renewable energy targets, mandates for renewable fuels), the price of fossil oil, and the scale of the industry.","uuid":"a9374674-a6dd-3284-9a4a-8d87df41c91d","authors":[{"forename":"Damien R.","surname":"Farine"},{"forename":"Deborah A.","surname":"O'Connell"},{"forename":"Robert","surname":"John Raison"},{"forename":"Barrie M.","surname":"May"},{"forename":"Michael H.","surname":"O'Connor"},{"forename":"Debbie F.","surname":"Crawford"},{"forename":"Alexander","surname":"Herr"},{"forename":"Joely A.","surname":"Taylor"},{"forename":"Tom","surname":"Jovanovic"},{"forename":"Peter K.","surname":"Campbell"},{"forename":"Michael I.

The invasion of exotic perennial grasses throughout the globe is particularly problematic given their impacts on a broad range of native plant communities and livelihoods.

Using species distribution modelling we investigated potential changes to the location of climatically suitable habitat for some exotic perennial grass species currently in Australia, under a range of future climate scenarios for the decade centred around 2050. We focus on eleven species shortlisted or declared as the Weeds of National Significance or Alert List species in Australia, which have also become successful invaders in other parts of the world. Our results indicate that the extent of climatically suitable habitat available for all of the exotic grasses modelled is projected to decrease under climate scenarios for 2050.

Combined with information on other aspects of establishment risk (e.g. demographic rates, human-use, propagule pressure), predictions of reduced climatic suitability provide justification for re-assessing which weeds are prioritised for intensive management as the climate changes.","uuid":"326a34e3-35f5-3e30-9a1b-2b63eac92d54","authors":[{"forename":"Rachael V.","surname":"Gallagher"},{"forename":"D.","surname":"Englert Duursma"},{"forename":"J.","surname":"O\u2019Donnell"},{"forename":"Peter D.","surname":"Wilson"},{"forename":"Paul O.","surname":"Downey"},{"forename":"L.","surname":"Hughes"},{"forename":"Michelle R.","surname":"Leishman"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Biological Invasions","firstAuthor":"Gallagher"},{"id":"6016483624","title":"Using diverse data sources to detect elevational range changes of birds on Mount Kinabalu, Malaysian Borneo","type":"Journal Article","issue":"25","url":"http:\/\/rmbr.nus.edu.sg\/rbz\/biblio\/s25\/s25rbz197-247.pdf","tags":["2012","Aichi_E","AU","Australia","Borneo_biodiversity","GB","GBIF_used","GBIF_VIP","Malaysia","MY","SG","Singapore","Target_19","university","US"],"keywords":["checklist","citizen science","climate change","habitat loss","range limit"],"pages":"197-247","year":"2012","abstract":"Few empirical studies have measured the effects of climate change on tropical biodiversity, and this paucity has contributed to uncertainty in predicting the severity of climate change on tropical organisms. With regards to elevational changes, most studies have either re-sampled historical systematic survey sites or analyzed time series of occurrence data at long-term study sites. Such data sources are unavailable for most tropical mountains, so other methods of detecting elevational changes must be sought. Here we combine data from published checklists, recent fi eld work, peer-reviewed literature, unpublished reports, birdwatchers\u2019 trip reports, databases of birdwatchers\u2019 observations, audio recordings, and photographs to compare historical (pre-1998) and current (post-2006) bird distributions on Mt. Kinabalu in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. Records were carefully checked by experts on Bornean birds. More species are now known from Mt. Kinabalu, but historical data provided elevational range estimates for more species than current data because of extensive mountain-wide collections and surveys. Most elevational comparisons for this study had to be limited to the 1450\u20131900 m elevational band, where most of the recent work has been done. Information was compiled into an annotated list of 342 species from 200\u20134095 m. We present this list to encourage refi nement of the dataset and future work on elevational distributions on the mountain. Of 58 species with suffi cient data from 1450 m to the summit, 38 appear to have shifted their ranges (24 species upslope and 14 downslope). A total of 22 resident species have recently been observed above their published maximum elevation for Borneo. Some species that have shifted upwards, such as Chalcophaps indica and Pellorneum pyrrogenys, are now common or breeding at elevations above their published maximum. Fifteen species appear to have declined on the mountain, probably as a result of habitat loss outside the protected area. Several of the upslope shifts are probably attributable to climate change, but many downslope shifts may be artifacts of incomplete recent sampling. The upward shifts agree with the few other tropical range comparisons that have been published. Our approach demonstrates the viability of combining diverse data sources (of varying accuracy and bias) to detect distributional shifts from climate change.","uuid":"69f5e77e-38de-3dba-be86-a0ad5be784ff","authors":[{"forename":"J Berton C.","surname":"Harris"},{"forename":"Ding Li","surname":"Yong"},{"forename":"Frederick H.","surname":"Sheldon"},{"forename":"Andy J.","surname":"Boyce"},{"forename":"James A.","surname":"Eaton"},{"forename":"Henry","surname":"Bernard"},{"forename":"Alim","surname":"Biun"},{"forename":"Angela","surname":"Langevin"},{"forename":"Thomas E.","surname":"Martin"},{"forename":"Dan","surname":"Wei"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"The Raffles Bulletin of Zoology","firstAuthor":"Harris"},{"id":"6016483194","title":"Clonality Despite Sex: The Evolution of Host-Associated Sexual Neighborhoods in the Pathogenic Fungus Penicillium marneffei","type":"Journal Article","volume":"8","issue":"10","url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.ppat.1002851","tags":["2012","AU","Australia","China","Chinese Taipei","CN","GB","GBIF_used","GBIF_VIP","HK","Hong Kong","human health","IN","India","Taiwan","TH","Thailand","TW","US","Vietnam","Vietnam_biodiversity","VN"],"keywords":[],"pages":"e1002851","year":"2012","uuid":"65109d26-c5e7-3095-96e8-57a3c570a0c3","authors":[{"forename":"Daniel A.","surname":"Henk"},{"forename":"Revital","surname":"Shahar-Golan"},{"forename":"Khuraijam Ranjana","surname":"Devi"},{"forename":"Kylie J.","surname":"Boyce"},{"forename":"Nengyong","surname":"Zhan"},{"forename":"Natalie D.","surname":"Fedorova"},{"forename":"William C.","surname":"Nierman"},{"forename":"Po-Ren","surname":"Hsueh"},{"forename":"Kwok-Yung","surname":"Yuen"},{"forename":"Tran P.

A combination of current distribution records and published experimental data were used to construct separate models for the asexual and sexual lineages of Rhopalosiphum padi (Linnaeus) (Hemiptera: Aphididae). The two models were combined with knowledge of host plant presence to classify the global pest risk posed by R. padi. Whilst R. padi has a relatively limited area in which sexual lineages can persist year round, a much larger area is suitable for transient sexual and asexual lineages to exist. The greatest risk of establishment of persistent sexual and asexual populations is in areas with warm temperate climates. At the global scale the models show very little difference in risk patterns between natural rainfall and irrigation scenarios, but in Australia, the amount of land suitable for persistent asexual and transient sexual populations decreases (by 20%) if drought stress is no longer alleviated by irrigation. This approach proved useful for modelling the potential distribution of a species that has a variable life-history. We were able to use the model outputs to examine factors such as irrigation practices and host plant presence that altered the nature (transient or permanent) and extent of pest risk.

The native distribution in eastern Australia and naturalised distribution in Western Australia was also used to inform the model. Associations with soil types were assessed within the suitable bioclimatic region in Australia. The global projection of the model was tested against the distribution of soil types and the known successful and failed global introductions. The verified model was then projected to future conditions due to climate change. Optimal temperature for plant development was 28\u00b0C and the plant required 970 degree-days above a threshold of 10\u00b0C. Early collection records indicate that the species is native to Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria. The plant has been introduced elsewhere in Australia and throughout the world as a wool contaminant and as a potential pasture species, but some of the recorded establishments have failed to persist. The CLIMEX model projected to the world reflected effectively both the successful and failed distributions. The inclusion of soil associations improved the explanation of the observed distribution in Australia, but did not improve the ability to determine the potential distribution elsewhere, due to lack of similarity of soil types between continents. The addition of a climate change projection showed decreased suitability for this species in Australia, but increased suitability for other parts of the world, including regions where the plant previously failed to establish.","uuid":"4c457c67-ec89-3a5d-97d9-9970765319c2","authors":[{"forename":"Pippa J.","surname":"Michael"},{"forename":"Paul B.","surname":"Yeoh"},{"forename":"John K.","surname":"Scott"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"PLoS ONE","firstAuthor":"Michael"},{"id":"6016482944","title":"High connectivity among habitats precludes the relationship between dispersal and range size in tropical reef fishes","type":"Journal Article","volume":"35","issue":"1","url":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/j.1600-0587.2011.06874.x","tags":["2012","Aichi_C","AU","Australia","CA","Canada","ecology","GB","GBIF_used","GBIF_VIP","global_biodiversity","marine","marine_biodiversity","Target_11","UNEP","university","US"],"keywords":[],"pages":"89-96","year":"2012","abstract":"The hypothesis that pelagic larval duration (PLD) influences range size in marine species with a benthic adult stage and a pelagic larval period is intuitively attractive; yet, studies conducted to date have failed to support it. A possibility for the lack of a relationship between PLD and range size may stem from the failure of past studies to account for the eff ect of species evolutionary ages, which may add to the dispersal capabilities of species. However, if dispersal over ecological (i.e. PLD) and across evolutionary (i.e. species evolutionary age) time scales continues to show no eff ect on range size then an outstanding question is why? Here we collected data on PLD, evolutionary ages and range sizes of seven tropical fish families (five families were reef-associated and two have dwell demersal habitats) to explore the independent and interactive effects of PLD and evolutionary age on range size. Separate analyses on each family showed that even after controlling for evolutionary age, PLD has an insignificant or a very small effect on range size. To shed light on why dispersal has such a limited effect on range size, we developed a global ocean circulation model to quantify the connectivity among tropical reefs relative to the potential dispersal conferred by PLD. We found that although there are several areas of great isolation in the tropical oceans, most reef habitats are within the reach of most species given their PLDs. These results suggest that the lack of habitat isolation can potentially render the constraining effect of dispersal on range size insignificant and explain why dispersal does not relate to range size in reef fishes.","uuid":"158bd6c8-475d-3459-bcb9-1a8b97b39603","authors":[{"forename":"Camilo","surname":"Mora"},{"forename":"Eric A.","surname":"Treml"},{"forename":"Jason","surname":"Roberts"},{"forename":"Kate","surname":"Crosby"},{"forename":"Denis","surname":"Roy"},{"forename":"Derek P.","surname":"Tittensor"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Ecography","firstAuthor":"Mora"},{"id":"6016482604","title":"A Common View of the Opportunities, Challenges, and Research Actions for Pongamia in Australia","type":"Journal Article","volume":"5","issue":"3","url":"http:\/\/www.springerlink.com\/content\/506205400h170m31\/\nhttp:\/\/www.springerlink.com\/index\/10.1007\/s12155-012-9190-6","tags":["2012","agriculture","Aichi_A","AU","Australia","biofuel","CSIRO","GBIF_used","GBIF_VIP","global_biodiversity","supplement","Target_4"],"keywords":["growth","Karanja","Millettia","oil seed","Pongamia","yield"],"pages":"778-800","year":"2012","abstract":"Interest in biofuels is increasing in Australia due to volatile and rising oil prices, the need to reduce GHG emissions, and the recent introduction of a price on carbon.

Two potential invasion hotspot regions were identified under current and projected climates: the south west corner of Western Australia (SW), and south eastern Australia (SE).

The area of both hotspots was predicted to retract southward and towards the coast under future climate scenarios, reducing in size by 81% (SW) and 71% (SE) by 2050.

Location: Twenty-five countries in Central and South America, and the West Indies. Methods: Chloroplast simple sequence repeats (cpSSR; eight loci) were assayed in 67 populations (240 individuals) sampled from the full geographic range of C. alliodora. Chloroplast (trnH\u2013psbA) and nuclear (internal transcribed spacer, ITS) DNA sequences were sampled from a geographically representative subset. Genetic structure was determined with samova, structure and haplotype networks. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) and rarefaction analyses were used to compare regional haplotype diversity and differentiation. Results Although the ITS region was polymorphic it revealed limited phylogeographic structure, and trnH\u2013psbA was monomorphic. However, structure analysis of cpSSR variation recovered three broad demes spanning Central America (Deme 1), the Greater Antilles and the Choc\u00f3 (Deme 2), and the Lesser Antilles and cis-Andean South America (Deme 3). samova showed two predominant demes (Deme 1 + 2 and Deme 3). The greatest haplotype diversity was detected east of the Andes, while significantly more genetic variation was partitioned among trans-Andean populations. Populations experiencing high precipitation seasonality (dry ecotype) had greater levels of genetic variation. Main conclusions Cordia alliodora displayed weak cis- and trans-Andean phylogeographic structure based on DNA sequence data, indicative of historical dispersal around this barrier and genetic exchange across its broad range. The cpSSR data revealed phylogeographic structure corresponding to three biogeographic zones. Patterns of genetic diversity are indicative of an origin in the seasonally dry habitats of South America. Therefore, C. alliodora fits the disperser hypothesis for widespread Neotropical species. Dispersal is evident in the West Indies and the northern Andean cordilleras. The dry ecotype harbours genetic variation that is likely to represent the source for the establishment of populations under future warmer and drier climatic scenarios.","uuid":"b6f163af-a513-3bc1-acfb-e8fc76d5e1b7","authors":[{"forename":"Paul D.","surname":"Rymer"},{"forename":"Christopher W.","surname":"Dick"},{"forename":"Giovanni G.","surname":"Vendramin"},{"forename":"Anna","surname":"Buonamici"},{"forename":"David","surname":"Boshier"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Journal of Biogeography","firstAuthor":"Rymer"},{"id":"6016484954","title":"Climate Change Impacts on the Future Distribution of Date Palms: A Modeling Exercise Using CLIMEX","type":"Journal Article","volume":"7","issue":"10","url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0048021","tags":["2012","agriculture","Aichi_B","AU","Australia","GBIF_used","GBIF_VIP","global_biodiversity","plants","Target_7"],"keywords":[],"pages":"e48021","year":"2012","abstract":"Climate is changing and, as a consequence, some areas that are climatically suitable for date palm (Phoenix dactylifera L.) cultivation at the present time will become unsuitable in the future.

Despite being one of the most long-standing puzzles in ecology4, we still have little understanding of how temperature sets geographic range boundaries5. Herewe show that marine and terrestrial ectotherms differ in the degree to which they fill their potential latitudinal ranges, as predicted from their thermal tolerance limits. Marine ectotherms more fully occupy the extent of latitudes tolerable within their thermal tolerance limits, and are consequently predicted to expand at their polewardrange boundaries and contract at their equatorward boundaries with climate warming. In contrast, terrestrial ectotherms are excluded from the warmest regions of their latitudinal range; thus, the equatorward, or \u2018trailing\u2019 range boundaries, may not shift consistently towards the poles with climate warming. Using global observations of climate- induced range shifts, we test this prediction and show that in the ocean, shifts at both range boundaries have been equally responsive, whereas on land, equatorward range boundaries have lagged in response to climate warming. These results indicate that marine species\u2019 ranges conform more closely to their limits of thermal tolerance, and thus range shifts will be more predictable and coherent. However, on land, warmer range boundaries are not at equilibrium with heat tolerance. Understanding the relative contribution of factors other than temperature in controlling equatorward range limits is critical for predicting distribution changes, with implications for population and community viability.","uuid":"9712ed9e-813c-3c41-9974-c0276fc16f85","authors":[{"forename":"Jennifer M.","surname":"Sunday"},{"forename":"Amanda E.","surname":"Bates"},{"forename":"Nicholas K.","surname":"Dulvy"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Nature Climate Change","firstAuthor":"Sunday"},{"id":"6016482994","title":"Sensitivity Analysis of CLIMEX Parameters in Modelling Potential Distribution of Lantana camara L.","type":"Journal Article","volume":"7","issue":"7","url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22815881","tags":["2012","Aichi_B","AU","Australia","Australia_biodiversity","CLIMEX","GBIF_primary","GBIF_used","GBIF_VIP","Global_biodiversity","invasive","needs_review","niche_modeling","SDM","Target_9","university"],"keywords":[],"pages":"e40969","year":"2012","abstract":"A process-based niche model of L. camara L.

A sensitivity analysis was conducted to identify the model parameters that had the most influence on lantana distribution. The changes in suitability were assessed by mapping the regions where the distribution changed with each parameter alteration. This allowed an assessment of where, within Australia, the modification of each parameter was having the most impact, particularly in terms of the suitable and highly suitable locations. The sensitivity of various parameters was also evaluated by calculating the changes in area within the suitable and highly suitable categories. The limiting low temperature (DV0), limiting high temperature (DV3) and limiting low soil moisture (SM0) showed highest sensitivity to change. The other model parameters were relatively insensitive to change. Highly sensitive parameters require extensive research and data collection to be fitted accurately in species distribution models. The results from this study can inform more cost effective development of species distribution models for lantana. Such models form an integral part of the management of invasive species and the results can be used to streamline data collection requirements for potential distribution modelling.","uuid":"9456b4b1-7845-3ec6-8651-a159dc2493a4","authors":[{"forename":"Subhashni","surname":"Taylor"},{"forename":"Lalit","surname":"Kumar"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Taylor"},{"id":"6016482764","title":"Climate Change and the Potential Distribution of an Invasive Shrub, Lantana camara L","type":"Journal Article","volume":"7","issue":"4","url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0035565","tags":["2012","Aichi_B","AU","Australia","climate","CLIMEX","CSIRO","GBIF_primary","GBIF_used","GBIF_VIP","Global_biodiversity","invasive","niche_modeling","SDM","supplement","Target_9","university"],"notes":"btaylo36@une.edu.au","keywords":[],"pages":"e35565","year":"2012","abstract":"The threat posed by invasive species, in particular weeds, to biodiversity may be exacerbated by climate change.

Lantana is an invasive woody shrub species that has a profound economic and environmental impact worldwide. CLIMEX was used to develop a process-based niche model of lantana to estimate its potential distribution under current and future climate. Two Global Climate Models (GCMs), CSIRO-Mk3.0 and MIROC-H, were used to explore the impacts of climate change. These models were run with the A1B and A2 scenarios for 2030, 2070 and 2100. Further refinements of the potential distributions were carried out through the integration of fine scale soil drainage data in a Geographic Information System (GIS). The results from both GCMs show a progressive reduction in climatic suitability for lantana in Queensland. The MIROC-H projects a larger area as remaining at risk of lantana invasion in 2100 compared to CSIRO-Mk3.0. Inclusion of soil drainage data results in a more refined distribution. Overall results show a dramatic reduction in potential distribution of lantana in Queensland in the long term (2100). However, in the short term (2030), areas such as South East Queensland and the Wet Tropics, both regions of significant ecological importance, remain at risk of invasion consistently under both GCMs and with both the climate only and climate and soil drainage models. Management of lantana in these regions will need to be prioritized to protect environmental assets of ecological significance.","uuid":"3ac095a5-2f44-3ba2-999b-ce53d4aa85af","authors":[{"forename":"Subhashni","surname":"Taylor"},{"forename":"Lalit","surname":"Kumar"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Journal of Environmental Management","firstAuthor":"Taylor"},{"id":"6016483934","title":"Photosynthetic pathway and ecological adaptation explain stomatal trait diversity amongst grasses","type":"Journal Article","volume":"193","issue":"2","url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22040513","tags":["2012","AU","Australia","conservation","GB","GBIF_used","university","US"],"keywords":["Adaptation","Ecosystem","Heritable","Photosynthesis","Photosynthesis: physiology","Phylogeny","Physiological","Plant Stomata","Plant Stomata: cytology","Plant Stomata: physiology","Poaceae","Poaceae: genetics","Poaceae: physiology","Quantitative Trait","Rain","Species Specificity","Surface Properties","Water"],"pages":"387-96","year":"2012","abstract":"The evolution of C(4) photosynthesis in plants has allowed the maintenance of high CO(2) assimilation rates despite lower stomatal conductances.

Their progress is measured in code-compliant species descriptions that include text, images, type material and molecular sequences. It is from this material that other researchers are to identify individuals of the same species in future observations. It has been estimated that 13% to 22% (depending on taxonomic group) of described species have only ever been observed once. Species that have only been observed at the time and place of their original description are referred to as oncers. Oncers are important to our current understanding of biodiversity. They may be validly described species that are members of a rare biosphere, or they may indicate endemism, or that these species are limited to very constrained niches. Alternatively, they may reflect that taxonomic practices are too poor to allow the organism to be re-identified or that the descriptions are unknown to other researchers. If the latter are true, our current tally of species will not be an accurate indication of what we know. In order to investigate this phenomenon and its potential causes, we examined the microbial eukaryote genus Gymnodinium. This genus contains 268 extant species, 103 (38%) of which have not been observed since their original description. We report traits of the original descriptions and interpret them in respect to the status of the species. We conclude that the majority of oncers were poorly described and their identity is ambiguous. As a result, we argue that the genus Gymnodinium contains only 234 identifiable species. Species that have been observed multiple times tend to have longer descriptions, written in English. The styles of individual authors have a major effect, with a few authors describing a disproportionate number of oncers.

Previous molecular phylogenetic analyses, based on limited taxon sampling, have indicated that the small genus Fitzalania (2 spp.) is nested within Meiogyne. The centre of diversity of the Meiogyne-Fitzalania group lies in Australia (6 spp.) and New Caledonia (4 spp.); this is unique in Annonaceae, some of whose Australian and New Caledonian lineages have been hypothesised to have originated in situ from Gondwanan ancestors. Phylogenetic reconstructions based on chloroplast DNA sequence data of 19 accessions, representing 14 of the 17 species in the Meiogyne-Fitzalania group (ca. 8.6 kb) as well as 67 representatives of all major clades of Annonaceae (ca. 5.1 kb), were performed to clarify the phylogenetic relationships of Meiogyne and Fitzalania. The results show that Fitzalania is deeply nested within an Australasian-Pacific clade of Meiogyne species. The inclusion of species assigned to hieniodendron and Oncodostigma in eiogyne, as proposed in the most recent revision of Meiogyne, is also corroborated. Fossil-calibrated molecular divergence estimates under an uncorrelated-rates relaxed molecular clock model were used to investigate the timing of the crown group diversification. The Meiogyne crown group was inferred to have originated in the late Oligocene or Miocene, and initially diversified in continental Southeast Asia, western Malesia and the Philippines. All Australasian-Pacific taxa formed a single derived clade, and most diversification within this clade occurred in the late Miocene and Pliocene. A complex combination of factors such as fragmentation of once wider distribution areas due to climate fluctuations and subsequent vicariance, range expansion by dispersal to Pacific islands and subsequent differentiation, and ecological adaptation to local climatic and edaphic habitat conditions is hypothesised to underlie the diversification of Meiogyne in Australasia and the Pacific.","uuid":"b01b67ba-3d9d-3224-8349-6da810329b37","authors":[{"forename":"Daniel C.","surname":"Thomas"},{"forename":"Siddharthan","surname":"Surveswaran"},{"forename":"Bine","surname":"Xue"},{"forename":"Garry","surname":"Sankowsky"},{"forename":"Johan B.","surname":"Mols"},{"forename":"Paul J.A.","surname":"Ke\u00dfler"},{"forename":"Richard M.K.","surname":"Saunders"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Thomas"},{"id":"6016484544","title":"Humans introduce viable seeds to the Arctic on footwear","type":"Journal Article","volume":"14","issue":"3","url":"http:\/\/www.springerlink.com\/index\/10.1007\/s10530-011-0098-4","tags":["2012","2013_GBSS","Aichi_B","arctic","Arctic_biodiversity","AU","Australia","checklist","GBIF_Norway","GBIF_used","invasive","museum","NO","Norway","Target_9","university"],"keywords":["Alien","Dispersal","Germination","Human-mediated dispersal","Non-indigenous","Propagule pressure"],"pages":"567-577","year":"2012","abstract":"Expanding visitation to Polar regions combined with climate warming increases the potential for alien species introduction and establishment.

Leptospirosis is a globally important emerging zoonosis, caused by spirochaete bacteria, borne by many mammalian hosts, and also transmitted environmentally. We propose that leptospirosis incidence in humans is also linked to ecosystem disruption, and that reduced biodiversity (the diversity of species within an ecological community) may be associated with increased leptospirosis incidence. To investigate this hypothesis, the relationship between biodiversity levels of island nations and their annual leptospirosis incidence rates (adjusted for GDP per capita) was examined by linear correlation and regression.

However, 70% of purportedly extinct mammals are known from fewer than five sightings, and such models do not include some important indicators of the likelihood of extinction such as threats, biological traits, search effort, and demography. Previously, we developed a quantitative method that we based on species' traits in which we used Cox proportional hazards regression to calculate the probability of rediscovery of species regarded as extinct. Here, we used two versions of the Cox regression model to determine the probability of extinction in purportedly extinct mammals and compared the results of these two models with those of stationary Poisson, nonparametric, and Weibull sighting-distribution models. For mammals with five or more sightings, the stationary Poisson model categorized all but two critically endangered (flagged as possibly extinct) species in our data set as extinct, and results with this model were consistent with current categories of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. The scores of probability of rediscovery for individual species in one version of our Cox regression model were correlated with scores assigned by the stationary Poisson model. Thus, we used this Cox regression model to determine the probability of extinction of mammals with sparse records. On the basis of the Cox regression model, the most likely mammals to be rediscovered were the Montane monkey-faced bat (Pteralopex pulchra), Armenian myotis (Myotis hajastanicus), Alcorn's pocket gopher (Pappogeomys alcorni), and Wimmer's shrew (Crocidura wimmeri).

Conservation and protection of these species is important as they represent sources of novel therapeutic phytochemical compounds and are culturally valuable. Information on the spatial distribution and use of customary medicinal plants is often inadequate and fragmented, posing limitations on the identification and conservation of species-rich areas and culturally valuable habitats. In this study, the habitat suitability modeling program, MaxEnt, was used to predict the potential ecological niches of 431 customary medicinal plant species, based on bioclimatic variables. Specimen locality records were obtained from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) data portal and from Australia's Virtual Herbarium (AVH). Ecological niche models of 414 predicted species, which had 30 or more occurrence points, were used to produce maps indicating areas that were ecologically suitable for multiple species (concordance of high predicted ecological suitability) and having cultural values. For the concordance map, individual species niche models were thresholded and summed. To derive a map of culturally valuable areas, customary medicinal uses from Customary Medicinal Knowledgebase (CMKb) (www.biolinfo.org\/cmkb) were used to weight individual species models, resulting in a value within each grid cell reflecting its cultural worth. Even though the available information is scarce and fragmented, our approach provides an opportunity to infer areas predicted to be suitable for multiple species (i.e. concordance hotspots) and to estimate the cultural value of a particular geographical area. Our results also indicate that to conserve bio-cultural diversity, comprehensive information and active participation of Aboriginal communities is indispensable.","uuid":"08dd1445-8821-3d72-a2b4-15a746b380a3","authors":[{"forename":"Jitendra","surname":"Gaikwad"},{"forename":"Peter D.","surname":"Wilson"},{"forename":"Shoba","surname":"Ranganathan"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Gaikwad"},{"id":"6016480164","title":"Designing criteria suites to identify discrete and networked sites of high value across manifestations of biodiversity","type":"Journal Article","volume":"Online","issue":"14","url":"http:\/\/www.springerlink.com\/index\/10.1007\/s10531-011-0116-y","tags":["2011","Aichi_C","AU","Australia","GBIF_acknowledged","GBIF_cited","GBIF_used","GBIF_VIP","informatics","Target_11","university","US"],"keywords":["across","biodiversity","criteria","Data quality","Designing","discrete","high","identify","manifestations","networked","Protected area","Reserve","Site network","sites","Spatial planning","suites","Systematic conservation planning","value"],"pages":"3363-3383","year":"2011","abstract":"Suites of criteria specifying ecological, biological, social, economic, and governance properties enable the systematic identification of sites and networks of high biodiversity value, and can support balancing ecological and socioeconomic objectives of biodiversity conservation in terrestrial and marine spatial planning.

Results The macroecological patterns of the three distributional metrics displayed lognormal-like frequency distributions. Most invasive species had significantly lower percolation exponents and larger native ranges than expected from random draws from the entire assemblage of Australian acacias, but percolation intercepts were not significantly different. This can be explained by a selection bias at the early stages of invasion. Main conclusions The outcome of the natural experiment of transplanting many Australian acacias into novel environments is not random. While invasive species have a particular macroecological pattern, this can be explained by the observation that species with large native ranges and low percolation exponents (i.e. high population increase rate) are most likely to have been introduced and naturalized. Whether this pattern is an artefact of human selection or reflects a human bias towards selecting invasive species remains to be seen.","uuid":"17411e1a-15b8-3049-95b2-780e731091dc","authors":[{"forename":"Cang","surname":"Hui"},{"forename":"David M.","surname":"Richardson"},{"forename":"Mark P.","surname":"Robertson"},{"forename":"John R.

Studies of the effects of different litter species and combinations are rare in tropical forests and absent from African forests. Therefore we investigated: (1) Are there differences in litter decomposition in two forest types differing in tree diversity; and (2) is litter decomposition diversity-dependent? Location: Old-growth moist evergreen tropical forest Dja Faunal Reserve, southeast Cameroon. Methods We calculate decomposition rates (leaf litter fall\/leaf litter standing crop) along a tree diversity gradient in two forest types (naturally occurring low-diversity monodominant and adjacent higher-diversity mixed forest). Both forests experience the same climate on the same soil type; the former is dominated by a single species, Gilbertiodendron dewevrei (De Wild.) J. L\u00e9onard, probably due to lack of a long-term disturbance and has similar edaphic factors. Decomposition experiments were conducted in both forest types using single and mixed species litter bags of standard high-quality (bay leaves; Laurus nobilis L.) and low-quality (G. dewevrei) litter over 9 months. Results The estimated decomposition rate in mixed forest was four times faster than in monodominant forest, and not significantly correlated with local quadrat-scale tree species diversity. The litter bag experiment showed that decomposition of high-quality leaves was faster than low-quality leaves (k values: 2.0 yr\u22121 vs 0.6 yr\u22121). Decay rates for each single species litter type were not significantly different in both forest types. However, G. dewevrei litter in mixed bags decomposed faster than in single-species bags in mixed forest, suggesting an impact of litter mixing on decomposition. In addition, bay litter in mixed bags decomposed faster in mixed than in monodominant forests across the three study sites. Conclusion The observed difference in litter decomposition rate between low-diversity monodominant and adjacent high-diversity forest is more likely due to dominance of low-quality G. dewevrei litter, rather than low-diversity of the litter itself.","uuid":"65d161a8-c8b8-35aa-b809-ac5a7ed9b0cf","authors":[{"forename":"Kelvin S.

Dynamic spread modelling is a potentially valuable tool to assist regional and central government authorities to monitor and control invasive species. To date a lack of suitable data has meant that most broad scale dispersal models have not been validated with independent datasets, and so their predictive ability and reliability has remained unscrutinised. A dynamic, stochastic dispersal model of the widely invasive plant Buddleja davidii was calibrated on European spread data and then used to project the temporal progression of B. davidii's distribution in New Zealand, starting from several different historical distributions. To assess the model's performance, we constructed an occupancy map based on the average number of simulation realisations that have a population present. The application of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves to occupancy maps is introduced, but with specificity substituted by the proportion of available area used in a realisation. A derivative measure, the partial area under these curves when assessed through time (pAUC), is introduced and used to assess overall performance of the spread model. The model was able to attain a high level of model sensitivity, encompassing all of the known locations within the occupancy envelope. However, attempting to simulate the spread of this invasive species beyond a decade had very low model specificity. This is due to several factors, including the exponential process of spread (the further a population spreads the more sites exist from which it can spread stochastically), and the Markovian chain property of the stochastic system whereby differences between realisations compound through time. These features are seen in many reports of spread models, without being explicitly acknowledged. Our measure of pAUC through time allows a model's temporal performance and its specificity to be simultaneously assessed. While the rapid deterioration in model performance limits the utility of this type of modelling for forecasting long-term broad-scale strategic management of biological invasions, it does not necessarily limit its attractiveness for informing smaller scale and shorter term invasion management activities such as surveillance, containment and local eradication.","uuid":"8cefd19a-f785-3f65-9b8e-c757bb856dfd","authors":[{"forename":"Joel P.W.","surname":"Pitt"},{"forename":"Darren J.","surname":"Kriticos"},{"forename":"Michael B.","surname":"Dodd"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Ecological Modelling","firstAuthor":"Pitt"},{"id":"6016479314","title":"Phylogeny of kangaroo apples (Solanum subg.

This has created the opportunity to explore how evolutionary, ecological, historical and sociological factors interact to affect the distribution, usage, invasiveness and perceptions of a globally important group of plants. This editorial provides the background for the 20 papers in this special issue of Diversity and Distributions that focusses on the global cross-disciplinary experiment of introduced Australian acacias. Location Australia and global. Methods The papers of the special issue are discussed in the context of a unified framework for biological invasions. Distributions of species were mapped across Australia, their representation in bioclimatic zones examined and the potential global distribution of the group modelled. By collating a variety of different lists, we determined which Australian acacias have reached different stages in the introduction-naturalization-invasion continuum in different parts of the world. Paradigms and key research questions relating to barriers to invasion, stages of invasion and management perceptions are sketched. Results According to our global database of Australian acacia records, 386 species have been moved outside Australia by human agency, 71 species are naturalized or weedy, and 23 are unequivocally invasive. Climatic models suggest that about a third of the world\u2019s land surface is climatically suitable for Australian acacias. Many species are commercially important crops or are useful for other purposes and have been extensively planted, and many different human perceptions of Australian acacias exist in different parts of the world. The papers in the special issue cover all the barriers, stages and processes that define biological invasions and touch on many aspects: history and the human dimension; aspects of the species pool; species traits; biotic interactions; climate and niche; and management. Main conclusions Australian acacias are an excellent model group for examining interactions between evolutionary, ecological and socio-economic drivers of species introductions. New insights have emerged on the biological, ecological and evolutionary correlates of naturalization and invasion, but human usage factors permeate all explanatory models. Understanding and managing introduced Australian acacias requires a fundamental and integrative appreciation of both intrinsic (e.g. species traits) and extrinsic (e.g. human usage and perceptions) aspects. \u00aa 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd DOI: 10.1111\/j","uuid":"b61476d7-f069-3d29-9b61-a512d1fc4538","authors":[{"forename":"David M.","surname":"Richardson"},{"forename":"Jane","surname":"Carruthers"},{"forename":"Cang","surname":"Hui"},{"forename":"Fiona A.

Location Australia, South Africa. Methods We built bioclimatic models for Acacia cyclops and Acacia pycnantha using two discriminatory correlative models (MaxEnt and Boosted Regression Trees) and a mechanistic niche model (CLIMEX). We fitted models using two training data sets: native-range data only (\u2018restricted\u2019) and all available global data excluding South Africa (\u2018full\u2019). We compared the ability of these techniques to project suitable climate for independent records of the species in South Africa. In addition, we assessed the global potential distributions of the species to projected climate change. Results All model projections assessed against their training data, the South African data and globally were statistically significant. In South Africa and globally, the additional information contained in the full data set generally improved model sensitivity, but at the expense of increased modelled prevalence, particularly in extrapolation areas for the correlative models. All models projected some climatically suitable areas in South Africa not currently occupied by the species. At the global scale, widespread and biologically unrealistic projections by the correlative models were explained by open-ended response curves, a problem which was not always addressed by broader background climate space or by the extra information in the full data set. In contrast, the global projections for CLIMEX were more conservative. Projections into 2070 indicated a polewards shift in climate suitability and a decrease in model interpolation area. Main conclusions Our results highlight the importance of carefully interpreting model projections in novel climates, particularly for correlative models. Much work is required to ensure bioclimatic models performed in a robust and ecologically plausible manner in novel climates. We explore reasons for variations between models and suggest methods and techniques for future improvements.","uuid":"3c78d721-dcad-3051-bead-e605d8e0b1fd","authors":[{"forename":"Bruce L.","surname":"Webber"},{"forename":"Colin J.","surname":"Yates"},{"forename":"David C.","surname":"Le Maitre"},{"forename":"John K.","surname":"Scott"},{"forename":"Darren J.","surname":"Kriticos"},{"forename":"Noboru","surname":"Ota"},{"forename":"Asha","surname":"McNeill"},{"forename":"Johannes J.","surname":"Le Roux"},{"forename":"Guy F.","surname":"Midgley"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Webber"},{"id":"6016479514","title":"Distance-based methods for the analysis of maps produced by species distribution models","type":"Journal Article","volume":"2","issue":"6","url":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/j.2041-210X.2011.00115.x","tags":["2011","AU","Australia","GBIF_used","macroecology","niche_modeling","SDM","university"],"keywords":["analysis of variance","distance-based methods","image analysis","map comparison","principal coordinates analysis","species distribution model"],"pages":"623-633","year":"2011","abstract":"1.

Most records, however, come from the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) around the continent of Australia itself. The counts of species have been obtained from four primary databases (the Australian Faunal Directory, Codes for Australian Aquatic Biota, Online Zoological Collections of Australian Museums, and the Australian node of the Ocean Biogeographic Information System), but even these are an underestimate of described species. In addition, some partially completed databases for particular taxonomic groups, and specialized databases (for introduced and threatened species) have been used. Experts also provided estimates of the number of known species not yet in the major databases. For only some groups could we obtain an (expert opinion) estimate of undiscovered species. The databases provide patchy information about endemism, levels of threat, and introductions. We conclude that there are about 33,000 marine species (mainly animals) in the major databases, of which 130 are introduced, 58 listed as threatened and an unknown percentage endemic. An estimated 17,000 more named species are either known from the Australian EEZ but not in the present databases, or potentially occur there. It is crudely estimated that there may be as many as 250,000 species (known and yet to be discovered) in the Australian EEZ. For 17 higher taxa, there is sufficient detail for subdivision by Large Marine Domains, for comparison with other National and Regional Implementation Committees of the Census of Marine Life. Taxonomic expertise in Australia is unevenly distributed across taxa, and declining.

The potential invasive success of exotic plant species is thought to be associated with similarity in climate and biome between the original and novel range. We tested this assumption by quantifying the match between the realized climatic niches and biomes occupied in the exotic and native range of 26 plant species introduced to Australia. We then explored correlations between the propensity to shift climatic niche with residence time, invasion status, geographic range size, and species traits. 2. Occurrence data from the native and exotic range of 26 species introduced to Australia were obtained, and the overlap between native and exotic climate niches was calculated using between-class analysis. Shifts into novel biomes were assessed using a Geographic Information System (GIS). Correlations between introduction, distribution and species traits and the degree of climate matching were examined using nonparametric statistical tests. 3. Exotic species frequently occurred in climatic conditions outside those occupied in their native range (20 of 26 species). Nineteen species inhabited biomes in Australia not occupied in the native range and in some instances this shift represented the establishment of populations in novel biomes not present in the native range. No single-species trait, introduction or distributional characteristic was significantly associated with the degree of climatic niche shift. 4. Synthesis. Exotic species are able to occupy climate niches in the new range that differ substantially from those of the native range, and generally do not show biome conservatism between their native and introduced ranges. This implies that novel climatic conditions are not a major obstacle for exotic species establishing populations outside their native range. These results have important implications for the use and interpretation of ecological niche models used to predict the distribution of species in novel climates in time or space. The results also highlight the importance of alternate mechanisms, such as enemy release, phenotypic plasticity or rapid evolution, in the establishment of naturalized and invasive populations.","uuid":"55fd0eee-cf70-3c52-a0b4-04c6c835eada","authors":[{"forename":"Rachael V.","surname":"Gallagher"},{"forename":"Linda J.","surname":"Beaumont"},{"forename":"Lesley","surname":"Hughes"},{"forename":"Michelle R.","surname":"Leishman"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Journal of Ecology","firstAuthor":"Gallagher"},{"id":"6016477134","title":"Predicting the distributions of marine organisms at the global scale","type":"Journal Article","volume":"221","issue":"3","url":"http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/B6VBS-4XSCVHM-1\/2\/c8c322a135ca495968b2e0ae2d2b1a4c","tags":["2010","AU","Australia","BR","Brazil","DE","GB","GBIF_used","Germany","marine","niche_modeling","PH","Philippines","research institute","SDM","SE","Sweden","university"],"notes":"GBIF data was most likely used but it isn&#039;t explicitely stated.","keywords":["Expert review","Global marine biodiversity","Model comparison","Range maps","Species distribution modelling","Trawl surveys"],"pages":"467-478","year":"2010","abstract":"We present and evaluate AquaMaps, a presence-only species distribution modelling system that allows the incorporation of expert knowledge about habitat usage and was designed for maximum output of standardized species range maps at the global scale.

AquaMaps is compared with traditional presence-only species distribution modelling methods to determine the quality of outputs under equivalently automated conditions. The effect of the inclusion of expert knowledge to AquaMaps is also investigated. Model outputs were tested internally, through data partitioning, and externally against independent survey data to determine the ability of models to predict presence versus absence. Models were also tested externally by assessing correlation with independent survey estimates of relative species abundance. AquaMaps outputs compare well to the existing methods tested, and inclusion of expert knowledge results in a general improvement in model outputs. The transparency, speed and adaptability of the AquaMaps system, as well as the existing online framework which allows expert review to compensate for sampling biases and thus improve model predictions are proposed as additional benefits for public and research use alike.","uuid":"2ad27883-c831-379f-a779-5fa959a01b00","authors":[{"forename":"Jonathan","surname":"Ready"},{"forename":"Kristin","surname":"Kaschner"},{"forename":"Andy B.","surname":"South"},{"forename":"Paul D.","surname":"Eastwood"},{"forename":"Tony","surname":"Rees"},{"forename":"Josephine","surname":"Rius"},{"forename":"Eli","surname":"Agbayani"},{"forename":"Sven O.","surname":"Kullander"},{"forename":"Rainer","surname":"Froese"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Ecological Modelling","firstAuthor":"Ready"},{"id":"6016478134","title":"Angiosperm wood structure: Global patterns in vessel anatomy and their relation to wood density and potential conductivity","type":"Journal Article","volume":"97","issue":"2","url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21622380","tags":["2010","AU","Australia","GB","GBIF_acknowledged","GBIF_used","species distribution","university","University of Cambridge","US"],"keywords":["angiosperms","evolutionary divergences","potential conductivity","variances","vessel lumen fraction","vessel number","vessel size","wood density","xylem sapwood"],"pages":"207-15","year":"2010","abstract":"Woody stems comprise a large biological carbon fraction and determine water transport between roots and leaves; their structure and function can influence both carbon and hydrological cycles. While angiosperm wood anatomy and density determine hydraulic conductivity and mechanical strength, little is known about interrelations across many species. We compiled a global data set comprising two anatomical traits for 3005 woody angiosperms: mean vessel lumen area (\u0100) and number per unit area (N). From these, we calculated vessel lumen fraction (F = \u0100N) and size to number ratio (S = \u0100\/N), a new vessel composition index. We examined the extent to which F and S influenced potential sapwood specific stem conductivity (K(S)) and wood density (D; dry mass\/fresh volume). F and S varied essentially independently across angiosperms. Variation in K(S) was driven primarily by S, and variation in D was virtually unrelated to F and S. Tissue density outside vessel lumens (D(N)) must predominantly influence D. High S should confer faster K(S) but incur greater freeze-thaw embolism risk. F should also affect K(S), and both F and D(N) should influence mechanical strength, capacitance, and construction costs. Improved theory and quantification are needed to better understand ecological costs and benefits of these three distinct dimensions.","uuid":"7233aac2-2360-30c8-8499-2bb0f27d687d","authors":[{"forename":"Amy E.","surname":"Zanne"},{"forename":"Mark","surname":"Westoby"},{"forename":"Daniel S.","surname":"Falster"},{"forename":"David D.","surname":"Ackerly"},{"forename":"Scott R.","surname":"Loarie"},{"forename":"Sarah E.
