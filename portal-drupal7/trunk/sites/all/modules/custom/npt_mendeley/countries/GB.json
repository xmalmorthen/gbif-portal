Nevertheless, the key barriers to the collection and compilation of biodiversity information at a global scale have yet to be identified. We show that wealth, language, geographical location and security each play an important role in explaining spatial variations in data availability in four different types of biodiversity databases. The number of records per square kilometre is high in countries with high per capita gross domestic product (GDP), high proportion of English speakers and high security levels, and those located close to the country hosting the database; but these are not necessarily countries with high biodiversity. These factors are considered to affect data availability by impeding either the activities of scientific research or active international communications. Our results demonstrate that efforts to solve environmental problems at a global scale will gain significantly by focusing scientific education, communication, research and collaboration in low-GDP countries with fewer English speakers and located far from Western countries that host the global databases; countries that have experienced conflict may also benefit. Findings of this study may be broadly applicable to other fields that require the compilation of scientific knowledge at a global level.","uuid":"3581ece1-f1ae-3ed5-bdfc-aed112729478","authors":[{"forename":"Tatsuya","surname":"Amano"},{"forename":"William J.","surname":"Sutherland"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Proceedings.

The Sahara is the largest warm desert in the world and together with the arid Sahel displays high topographical and climatic heterogeneity, and has experienced recent and strong climatic oscillations that have greatly shifted biodiversity distribution and community composition. The large size, remoteness and long-term political instability of the Sahara-Sahel, have limited knowledge on its biodiversity. However, over the last decade, there have been an increasing number of published scientific studies based on modern geomatic and molecular tools, and broad sampling of taxa of these regions. This review tracks trends in knowledge about biodiversity patterns, processes and threats across the Sahara-Sahel, and anticipates needs for biodiversity research and conservation. Recent studies are changing completely the perception of regional biodiversity patterns. Instead of relatively low species diversity with distribution covering most of the region, studies now suggest a high rate of endemism and larger number of species, with much narrower and fragmented ranges, frequently limited to micro-hotspots of biodiversity. Molecular-based studies are also unravelling cryptic diversity associated with mountains, which together with recent distribution atlases, allows identifying integrative biogeographic patterns in biodiversity distribution. Mapping of multivariate environmental variation (at 1 km \u00d7 1 km resolution) of the region illustrates main biogeographical features of the Sahara-Sahel and supports recently hypothesised dispersal corridors and refugia. Micro-scale water-features present mostly in mountains have been associated with local biodiversity hotspots. However, the distribution of available data on vertebrates highlights current knowledge gaps that still apply to a large proportion of the Sahara-Sahel. Current research is providing insights into key evolutionary and ecological processes, including causes and timing of radiation and divergence for multiple taxa, and associating the onset of the Sahara with diversification processes for low-mobility vertebrates. Examples of phylogeographic patterns are showing the importance of allopatric speciation in the Sahara-Sahel, and this review presents a synthetic overview of the most commonly hypothesised diversification mechanisms. Studies are also stressing that biodiversity is threatened by increasing human activities in the region, including overhunting and natural resources prospection, and in the future by predicted global warming. A representation of areas of conflict, landmines, and natural resources extraction illustrates how human activities and regional insecurity are hampering biodiversity research and conservation. Although there are still numerous knowledge gaps for the optimised conservation of biodiversity in the region, a set of research priorities is provided to identify the framework data needed to support regional conservation planning.","uuid":"a3ae4f28-7b82-3b17-9f9f-bce9bf181d8d","authors":[{"forename":"Jos\u00e9 C.","surname":"Brito"},{"forename":"Raquel","surname":"Godinho"},{"forename":"Fernando","surname":"Mart\u00ednez-Freir\u00eda"},{"forename":"Juan M.","surname":"Pleguezuelos"},{"forename":"Hugo","surname":"Rebelo"},{"forename":"Xavier","surname":"Santos"},{"forename":"C\u00e2ndida G.","surname":"Vale"},{"forename":"Guillermo","surname":"Velo-Ant\u00f3n"},{"forename":"Zbyszek","surname":"Boraty\u0144ski"},{"forename":"S\u00edlvia B.","surname":"Carvalho"},{"forename":"S\u00f3nia","surname":"Ferreira"},{"forename":"Duarte V.","surname":"Gon\u00e7alves"},{"forename":"Teresa L.","surname":"Silva"},{"forename":"Pedro","surname":"Tarroso"},{"forename":"Jo\u00e3o C.","surname":"Campos"},{"forename":"Jo\u00e3o V.","surname":"Leite"},{"forename":"Joana","surname":"Nogueira"},{"forename":"Francisco","surname":"Alvares"},{"forename":"Neftal\u00ed","surname":"Sillero"},{"forename":"Andack S.","surname":"Sow"},{"forename":"Soumia","surname":"Fahd"},{"forename":"Pierre-Andr\u00e9","surname":"Crochet"},{"forename":"Salvador","surname":"Carranza"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Biological reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society","firstAuthor":"Brito"},{"id":"6016484934","title":"Reinvestigation of West African Surirellaceae (Bacillariophyta) described by Woodhead and Tweed from Sierra Leone","type":"Journal Article","volume":"28","issue":"2","url":"http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/0269249X.2012.752411","tags":["2013","Aichi_E","BE","Belgium","DE","GB","GBIF_used","Germany","Sierra Leone_biodiversity","Target_19","taxonomy"],"keywords":["diatoms","sierra leone","stenopterobia","surirella","taxonomy","west africa"],"pages":"121-129","year":"2013","abstract":"Microscope slides containing material from Sierra Leone used by Woodhead and Tweed to describe eight new Surirellaceae taxa in the mid-twentieth century were reinvestigated.

The realized climatic niche of an invasive species can be used to predict its potential distribution in new areas, providing a basis for screening procedures in the compilation of black and white lists to prevent new introductions. We tested this assertion by modeling the realized climatic niche of the Eastern grey squirrel Sciurus carolinensis. Maxent was used to develop three models: one considering only records from the native range (NRM), a second including records from native and invasive range (NIRM), a third calibrated with invasive occurrences and projected in the native range (RCM). Niche conservatism was tested considering both a niche equivalency and a niche similarity test. NRM failed to predict suitable parts of the currently invaded range in Europe, while RCM underestimated the suitability in the native range. NIRM accurately predicted both the native and invasive range. The niche equivalency hypothesis was rejected due to a significant difference between the grey squirrel\u2019s niche in native and invasive ranges. The niche similarity test yielded no significant results. Our analyses support the hypothesis of a shift in the species\u2019 climatic niche in the area of introductions.

Aquatic invasive species are a growing concern to environmental managers because of their diverse impacts on aquatic biodiversity and high eradication costs, necessitating effective management policies. In this study, we evaluate the ability of environmental and socio- economic factors to predict the risk of invasion in Great Britain and Ireland of 12 potential aquatic invaders covering all major aquatic groups. Despite their potential to inform risk assessments, this is the first time socio-economic factors related to propagule pressure have been specifically integrated in distribution modelling. 2. Species distribution models (SDM, MaxEnt algorithm) were calibrated with a set of envi- ronmental factors (e.g. bioclimatic, geographical and geological) and integrated with socio- economic (e.g. human influence index, population density, closeness to ports) predictors. 3. The inclusion of socio-economic factors in SDM did not affect accuracy scores (AUC already >0\ue00190), but their effects were more pronounced in spatial predictions, resulting in up to a sixfold amplification of the area predicted suitable for each species. Despite the inclusion of potential surrogates of water chemistry (e.g. geology) and propagule pressure (e.g. popula- tion density), temperature-related variables were most important predictors of aquatic species\u2019 distributions. 4. According to SDM, the environmental suitability for a suite of invaders belonging to dif- ferent taxonomic groups and regions of origin is greatest in east and south-east England and decreases towards the north and west. Multiple invasions in this region are of special concern, as species are known to modify their habitat facilitating subsequent invasions, thereby poten- tially exacerbating their impacts. 5. Major management regions to be prioritized in monitoring programmes include the Humber, Thames and Anglian River Basin Districts. Species of special concern include a mysid (Hemimysis anomala), a gammarid (Dikerogammarus villosus), a plant (Ludwigia grandiflora) and two crayfishes (Procambarus clarkii and P. fallax). 6. Synthesis and Applications. The inclusion of socio-economic factors in species distribution models has the potential to improve predictions of areas under a highest risk of multiple inva- sions and to help disentangle the complex interplay between biological invasions and global environmental and socio-economic processes. Such understanding is pivotal to prioritize limited resources for the optimum prevention and control of biological invasions.","uuid":"9d5857b7-abc5-318b-8f97-cd2d17ffeeb6","authors":[{"forename":"Belinda","surname":"Gallardo"},{"forename":"David C.","surname":"Aldridge"}],"editors":[{"forename":"Chris","surname":"Frid"}],"publication_outlet":"Journal of Applied Ecology","firstAuthor":"Gallardo"},{"id":"6016481554","title":"Evaluating the combined threat of climate change and biological invasions on endangered species","type":"Journal Article","volume":"160","url":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0006320713000402","tags":["2013","Aichi_B","Europe_biodiversity","freshwater","GB","GBIF_used","GBits_8","invasive","IUCN","Target_9"],"notes":"GBIF not primary data source","keywords":[],"pages":"225-233","year":"2013","abstract":"Climate change and invasive species are two major biodiversity threats expected to provoke extinctions of many species in the future.

We expected the native species to experience a gradual contraction over time in their geographic range size, while the invasive species would maintain or increase their spread; therefore, their overlap would increase, further threatening the conservation of the native species. To test these three hypotheses, ensemble species distribution models (SDMs) were calibrated with current distributions and projected onto present and 2050 future climatic scenarios. In agreement with our expectations, the 2050 scenarios suggested D. polymorpha may strongly benefit from climate changes (increase of 15\u201320% in range size), while the depressed river mussel would experience a considerable loss (14\u201336%), the overlap between both mussels increasing up to 24%.

Location: Europe and North America. Methods: A comprehensive cross-continental occurrence database of the zebra mussel was used to explore the species' native and invaded ranges using univariate and multivariate analyses. In addition, ecological niche models (ENMs, employing MaxEnt) were used to investigate the ability of the native and invaded ranges to describe the species' distribution elsewhere. Results: We found the zebra mussel to occupy different, but partly overlapping, environmental niches in the native Ponto-Caspian region and invaded European and North American regions. Accordingly, the ENMs calibrated with the native range accurately predicted regions of early colonization in Europe and North America, but not the subsequent expansion. ENMs calibrated with data from the European range failed to describe the invaded range in North America, and vice versa. Climate suitability curves further confirmed a progressive spatio-temporal stretching of the climatic tolerance of the zebra mussel. Main conclusions: This study provides novel evidence of multiple episodes of niche expansion in a notorious invasive species, and supports the use of partial ranges to better understand the species' spatio-temporal history of invasion. Separately, the native and invaded ranges provided important information regarding the species' environmental tolerance and the regions that are most suitable for first colonization, as well as identifying regions at risk in the case of a possible reintroduction. Collectively, the differences between the three ecological niche projections of the zebra mussel demonstrate that niche expansion of an invasive species within a new geographical region promotes the organism's further invasion in space and time, a process known as invasion ratcheting.","uuid":"d6322813-68e0-3e05-9e32-4a927bc0ed6a","authors":[{"forename":"Belinda","surname":"Gallardo"},{"forename":"Philine S.

Many species distributions observed on this island are extremely restricted, localized to mountains or rivers making biodiversity evaluation and conservation a difficult task. A rapid biodiversity assessment method based on acoustics was recently proposed. This method could help to document the unique spatial structure observed in New Caledonia. Here, this method was applied in an attempt to reveal differences among three mountain sites (Mandj\u00e9lia, Koghis and Aoupini\u00e9) with similar ecological features and species richness level, but with high beta diversity according to different microendemic assemblages. In each site, several local acoustic communities were sampled with audio recorders. An automatic acoustic sampling was run on these three sites for a period of 82 successive days. Acoustic properties of animal communities were analysed without any species identification. A frequency spectral complexity index (NP) was used as an estimate of the level of acoustic activity and a frequency spectral dissimilarity index (Df ) assessed acoustic differences between pairs of recordings. As expected, the index NP did not reveal significant differences in the acoustic activity level between the three sites. However, the acoustic variability estimated by the index Df , could first be explained by changes in the acoustic communities along the 24-hour cycle and second by acoustic dissimilarities between the three sites. The results support the hypothesis that global acoustic analyses can detect acoustic differences between sites with similar species richness and similar ecological context, but with different species assemblages. This study also demonstrates that global acoustic methods applied at broad spatial and temporal scales could help to assess local biodiversity in the challenging context of microendemism. The method could be deployed over large areas, and could help to compare different sites and determine conservation priorities.","uuid":"d62c6ad2-806e-3107-b09e-2737320b10fa","authors":[{"forename":"Amandine","surname":"Gasc"},{"forename":"J\u00e9r\u00f4me","surname":"Sueur"},{"forename":"Sandrine","surname":"Pavoine"},{"forename":"Roseli","surname":"Pellens"},{"forename":"Philippe","surname":"Grandcolas"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Gasc"},{"id":"6076031634","title":"Island Biogeography, the effects of taxonomic effort and the importance of island niche diversity to single island endemic species","type":"Journal Article","volume":"44","url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23985784","tags":["2013","Aichi_E","ecology","GB","GBIF_used","GBits_10","in_press","Target_19","taxonomy","United Kingdom"],"keywords":[],"year":"2013","abstract":"Island biogeography theory is fundamentally reliant on measuring the number of species per island and hence has taxonomy at its foundation. Yet as a metric used in tests of the theory, island species richness (S) has varied with time according to the level of taxonomic effort (a function of the rate of finding and describing species). Studies using a derivative of S, single-island-endemic species richness (SIE S), may be even more prone to change in taxonomic effort. Decreases or increases in species numbers resulting from taxonomic revision or increased sampling are likely to have a large effect on values of SIE S, as they tend to be smaller than total S for the same island. Using simple biogeography models, we analysed estimates of SIE S in plants, land snails, beetles and fungi from comprehensive datasets for eight island groups, produced species accumulation curves and applied Bayesian regression over five time periods. Explanatory power differed across taxa, but area and island age were not always the best explanatory variables, and niche diversity appeared to be important. Changing levels of SIE S over time had different effects on models with different taxa and between island archipelagos. The results indicated that the taxonomic effort that determines SIE S is important. However, as this cannot often be quantified, we suggest Bayesian approaches should be more useful than frequentist methods in evaluating SIE S in island biogeography theory. Fundamentally, the paper highlights the importance of taxonomy to theoretical biogeography.","uuid":"463b037d-5376-3fe7-be2d-87ecaaee66c7","authors":[{"forename":"Alan","surname":"Gray"},{"forename":"Stephen","surname":"Cavers"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Gray"},{"id":"6016481764","title":"Antarctic Crabs: Invasion or Endurance?","type":"Journal Article","volume":"8","issue":"7","url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0066981","tags":["2013","Aichi_B","Antarctica_biodiversity","GB","GBIF_primary","GBIF_used","GBIF_VIP","GBits_9","invasive","marine","Target_9"],"keywords":[],"pages":"e66981","year":"2013","abstract":"Recent scientific interest following the \u201cdiscovery\u201d of lithodid crabs around Antarctica has centred on a hypothesis that these crabs might be poised to invade the Antarctic shelf if the recent warming trend continues, potentially decimating its native fauna. This \u201cinvasion hypothesis\u201d suggests that decapod crabs were driven out of Antarctica 40\u201315 million years ago and are only now returning as \u201cwarm\u201d enough habitats become available. The hypothesis is based on a geographically and spatially poor fossil record of a different group of crabs (Brachyura), and examination of relatively few Recent lithodid samples from the Antarctic slope. In this paper, we examine the existing lithodid fossil record and present the distribution and biogeographic patterns derived from over 16,000 records of Recent Southern Hemisphere crabs and lobsters. Globally, the lithodid fossil record consists of only two known specimens, neither of which comes from the Antarctic. Recent records show that 22 species of crabs and lobsters have been reported from the Southern Ocean, with 12 species found south of 60\u00b0S. All are restricted to waters warmer than 0\u00b0C, with their Antarctic distribution limited to the areas of seafloor dominated by Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW). Currently, CDW extends further and shallower onto the West Antarctic shelf than the known distribution ranges of most lithodid species examined. Geological evidence suggests that West Antarctic shelf could have been available for colonisation during the last 9,000 years.

The Pyrenean desman, Galemys pyrenaicus, is a small semi-aquatic mammal that inhabits clean streams of the northern half of the Iberian Peninsula and is endangered in most of its geographic range, but its genetic structure is currently unknown. While the stringent ecological demands derived from its aquatic habitat might have caused a partition of the genetic diversity among river basins, Pleistocene glaciations would have generated a genetic pattern related to glacial refugia. Results To study the relative importance of historical and ecological factors in the genetic structure of G. pyrenaicus, we used mitochondrial and intronic sequences of specimens covering most of the species range. We show, first, that the Pyrenean desman has very low levels of genetic diversity compared to other mammals. In addition, phylogenetic and dating analyses of the mitochondrial sequences reveal a strong phylogeographic structure of a Middle Pleistocene origin, suggesting that the main lineages arose during periods of glacial isolation. Furthermore, both the spatial distribution of nuclear and mitochondrial diversity and the results of species distribution modeling suggest the existence of a major glacial refugium in the northwestern part of the Iberian Peninsula. Finally, the main mitochondrial lineages show a striking parapatric distribution without any apparent exchange of mitochondrial haplotypes between the lineages that came into secondary contact (although with certain permeability to nuclear genes), indicating incomplete mixing after the post-glacial recolonization. On the other hand, when we analyzed the partition of the genetic diversity among river basins, the Pyrenean desman showed a lower than expected genetic differentiation among main rivers. Conclusions The analysis of mitochondrial and intronic markers in G. pyrenaicus showed the predominant effects of Pleistocene glaciations on the genetic structure of this species, while the distribution of the genetic diversity was not greatly influenced by the main river systems. These results and, particularly, the discovery of a marked phylogeographic structure, may have important implications for the conservation of the Pyrenean desman.","uuid":"2b087440-dfb6-37c1-96bb-db2d6cbe36a0","authors":[{"forename":"Javier","surname":"Igea"},{"forename":"Pere","surname":"Aymerich"},{"forename":"Angel","surname":"Fern\u00e1ndez-Gonz\u00e1lez"},{"forename":"Jorge","surname":"Gonz\u00e1lez-Esteban"},{"forename":"Asunci\u00f3n","surname":"G\u00f3mez"},{"forename":"Roc\u00edo","surname":"Alonso"},{"forename":"Joaquim","surname":"Gos\u00e1lbez"},{"forename":"Jose","surname":"Castresana"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"BMC evolutionary biology","firstAuthor":"Igea"},{"id":"6016481444","title":"Predicting the Impact of Climate Change on Threatened Species in UK Waters.","type":"Journal Article","volume":"8","issue":"1","url":"http:\/\/www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov\/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3551960&tool=pmcentrez&rendertype=abstract","tags":["2013","Aichi_B","CA","Canada","fish","GB","GBIF_used","GB_biodiversity","marine","target_6","US"],"keywords":[],"pages":"e54216","year":"2013","abstract":"Global climate change is affecting the distribution of marine species and is thought to represent a threat to biodiversity. Previous studies project expansion of species range for some species and local extinction elsewhere under climate change. Such range shifts raise concern for species whose long-term persistence is already threatened by other human disturbances such as fishing. However, few studies have attempted to assess the effects of future climate change on threatened vertebrate marine species using a multi-model approach. There has also been a recent surge of interest in climate change impacts on protected areas. This study applies three species distribution models and two sets of climate model projections to explore the potential impacts of climate change on marine species by 2050. A set of species in the North Sea, including seven threatened and ten major commercial species were used as a case study. Changes in habitat suitability in selected candidate protected areas around the UK under future climatic scenarios were assessed for these species. Moreover, change in the degree of overlap between commercial and threatened species ranges was calculated as a proxy of the potential threat posed by overfishing through bycatch. The ensemble projections suggest northward shifts in species at an average rate of 27 km per decade, resulting in small average changes in range overlap between threatened and commercially exploited species. Furthermore, the adverse consequences of climate change on the habitat suitability of protected areas were projected to be small. Although the models show large variation in the predicted consequences of climate change, the multi-model approach helps identify the potential risk of increased exposure to human stressors of critically endangered species such as common skate (Dipturus batis) and angelshark (Squatina squatina).","uuid":"a72cc70c-88ef-3fb4-92e6-436e22364879","authors":[{"forename":"Miranda C.","surname":"Jones"},{"forename":"Stephen R.","surname":"Dye"},{"forename":"Jose A.","surname":"Fernandes"},{"forename":"Thomas L.","surname":"Fr\u00f6licher"},{"forename":"John K.","surname":"Pinnegar"},{"forename":"Rachel","surname":"Warren"},{"forename":"William W.

Few studies modelling species\u2019 distributions attempt to present multi-model outputs in a format most useful to the non-modelling community, and none of these have done so for the marine environment. 3. The problem of uncertainty is particularly prevalent in predicting the distribution of invasive alien species under climate change. As invasive alien species are one of the main drivers of biodiversity loss and may incur significant economic costs, the benefit of applying predictions to highlight areas of possible establishment and inform policy and management may be large. 4.

The ensemble incorporates predictions from three species distribution models, using data from two global climate models.

Methods We mapped the range of the subfamily Danthonioideae, and used 39,000 locality records and an ensemble modelling approach to define areas with suitable danthonioid habitat. We used a well-sampled, dated phylogeny to estimate the number and direction of historical dispersal events, based on parsimony optimization. We tested for the impact of wind direction on dispersal rate using a likelihood approach, and for the effects of barrier width with a regression approach. Results We found 17 geographically isolated areas with suitable habitats for danthonioids. All currently suitable Southern Hemisphere areas have been occupied, but three apparently suitable areas in the Northern Hemisphere have not. We infer that southern Africa was first occupied in the Oligocene and that dispersal to the other areas was initiated in the middle Miocene. Inferred dispersal rate was correlated with the width of the disjunctions, up to a distance of 5000 km. There was no support for wind direction having influenced differences in dispersal rate. Main conclusions The current range of the Danthonioideae can be predicted ecologically (areas with suitable habitat) and historically (the width of the disjunctions separating the areas with suitable habitat and the area of origin). The direction of dispersal is dictated by the area of origin and by serendipity: there is no evidence for general patterns of dispersal, for example for dispersal occurring more frequently over land than over sea or in an easterly versus a westerly direction around the Southern Hemisphere. Thus the range and range-filling of Danthonioideae can be accounted for by surprisingly few variables: habitat suitability, distance between suitable areas, and area of origin.","uuid":"718a4137-923d-39a1-a042-918d3fec3d05","authors":[{"forename":"H.","surname":"Peter Linder"},{"forename":"Alexandre","surname":"Antonelli"},{"forename":"Aelys M.","surname":"Humphreys"},{"forename":"Michael D.","surname":"Pirie"},{"forename":"Rafael O.","surname":"W\u00fcest"}],"editors":[{"forename":"Richard","surname":"Ladle"}],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Peter Linder"},{"id":"6016484484","title":"Afrotemperate Amphibians in southern and eastern Africa: a critical review","type":"Journal Article","volume":"62","issue":"1","url":"http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/21564574.2013.794866","tags":["2013","Africa_biodiversity","Aichi_E","GB","GBIF_used","GBits_9","Target_19"],"keywords":[],"pages":"5-20","year":"2013","abstract":"The term \u2018Afrotemperate\u2019 is taken to cover the area and fauna of the southern Cape, eastern highlands of South Africa, and intertropical highlands.

Another pattern is a concentration of species or genera on highlands of East Africa. A concentration of cool-preferring species in the south has led to the concept of this being a centre of endemism, with a radiation undergoing progressive attenuation northwards on highlands within the cartographic tropics; this concept is questioned in the case of several species, and a reverse direction of attenuation from East African highlands southwards is evident in others.

The two focal species differ radically in their phylogeographic structure, with R. temporaria being strongly variable among and within populations, and R. dalmatina homogeneous across Europe with a single strongly differentiated population in southern Italy. These differences were observed across the various markers studied, including microsatellites and SNP density, but especially in protein-coding nuclear genes where R. dalmatina had extremely low heterozygosity values across its range, including potential refugial areas, whereas R. temporaria had comparably high range-wide values, including many areas of probable postglacial colonization. A phylogeny of R. temporaria based on various concatenated mtDNA genes revealed that two haplotype clades endemic to Iberia form a paraphyletic group at the base of the cladogram, and all other haplotypes form a monophyletic group, in agreement with an Iberian origin of the species. Demographic analysis suggests that R. temporaria and R. dalmatina have genealogies of roughly the same time to coalescence (TMRCA \u223c3.5 mya for both species), but R. temporaria might have been been characterized by larger ancestral and current effective population sizes than R. dalmatina. The unusually high genetic variation in R. temporaria can therefore be explained by its early range expansion out of Iberia, with subsequent cycles of differentiation in cryptic glacial refugial areas followed by admixture, while the range expansion of R. dalmatina into central Europe is a more recent event.","uuid":"b330f971-716c-3e23-9946-69d5abe1d745","authors":[{"forename":"Miguel","surname":"Vences"},{"forename":"J","surname":"Susanne Hauswaldt"},{"forename":"Sebastian","surname":"Steinfartz"},{"forename":"Oliver","surname":"Rupp"},{"forename":"Alexander","surname":"Goesmann"},{"forename":"Sven","surname":"K\u00fcnzel"},{"forename":"Pablo","surname":"Orozco-Terwengel"},{"forename":"David R","surname":"Vieites"},{"forename":"Sandra","surname":"Nieto-Roman"},{"forename":"Sabrina","surname":"Haas"},{"forename":"Clara","surname":"Laugsch"},{"forename":"Marcelo","surname":"Gehara"},{"forename":"Sebastian","surname":"Bruchmann"},{"forename":"Maciej","surname":"Pabijan"},{"forename":"Ann-Kathrin","surname":"Ludewig"},{"forename":"Dirk","surname":"Rudert"},{"forename":"Claudio","surname":"Angelini"},{"forename":"Leo J.","surname":"Borkin"},{"forename":"Pierre-Andr\u00e9","surname":"Crochet"},{"forename":"Angelica","surname":"Crottini"},{"forename":"Alain","surname":"Dubois"},{"forename":"G.","surname":"Francesco Ficetola"},{"forename":"Pedro","surname":"Gal\u00e1n"},{"forename":"Philippe","surname":"Geniez"},{"forename":"Monika","surname":"Hachtel"},{"forename":"Olga","surname":"Jovanovic"},{"forename":"Spartak N.","surname":"Litvinchuk"},{"forename":"Petros","surname":"Lymberakis"},{"forename":"Annemarie","surname":"Ohler"},{"forename":"Nazar A.","surname":"Smirnov"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Molecular phylogenetics and evolution","firstAuthor":"Vences"},{"id":"6136736294","title":"A prioritized crop wild relative inventory to help underpin global food security","type":"Journal Article","volume":"167","url":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0006320713002851","tags":["2013","agriculture","Aichi_B","CO","Colombia","conservation","DE","DIVA-GIS","GB","GBIF_used","GBIF_VIP","GBits_10","Germany","global_biodiversity","Target_7","United Kingdom","US"],"keywords":[],"pages":"265-275","year":"2013","abstract":"The potentially devastating impacts of climate change on biodiversity and food security, together with the growing world population, means taking action to conserve crop wild relative (CWR) diversity is no longer an option\u2014it is an urgent priority.

SMR of 15 out of 17 species had a mass-scaling exponent between 2\/3 and 1, with no greater support for a 3\/4 rather than a 2\/3 scaling exponent. After accounting for taxonomy and variability in parameter estimates among species using variance-weighted linear mixed effects modelling, temperature sensitivity of SMR had an activation energy (Ea) of 0.16 for both Northern and Southern Hemisphere species which was lower than predicted under the metabolic theory of ecology (Ea 0.2-1.2 eV). Northern Hemisphere species, however, had a higher SMR at each habitat temperature, but a lower mass-scaling exponent relative to SMR. Evolutionary trade-offs that may be driving differences in metabolic rate (such as metabolic cold adaptation of Northern Hemisphere species) will have important impacts on species abilities to respond to changing environments.","uuid":"194e4898-d387-38cc-ae67-3f371e02a79a","authors":[{"forename":"Sue-Ann","surname":"Watson"},{"forename":"Simon A.","surname":"Morley"},{"forename":"Amanda E.","surname":"Bates"},{"forename":"Melody S.","surname":"Clark"},{"forename":"Robert W.","surname":"Day"},{"forename":"Miles","surname":"Lamare"},{"forename":"Stephanie M.","surname":"Martin"},{"forename":"Paul C.","surname":"Southgate"},{"forename":"Koh Siang","surname":"Tan"},{"forename":"Paul A.","surname":"Tyler"},{"forename":"Lloyd S.","surname":"Peck"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Watson"},{"id":"6016482074","title":"Post-glacial dispersal, rather than in situ glacial survival, best explains the disjunct distribution of the Lusitanian plant species Daboecia cantabrica (Ericaceae)","type":"Journal Article","volume":"online","url":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/j.1365-2699.2012.02789.x","tags":["2012","Aichi_E","GB","GBIF_used","Ireland_biodiversity","Portugal_biodiversity","Spain_biodiversity","Target_19"],"keywords":["Daboecia cantabrica","devensian glaciations","Ireland","last glacial maximum","Lusitanian flora","palaeodistribution modelling","phylogeography","Spain"],"year":"2012","abstract":"Aim The distribution of the Lusitanian flora and fauna, species which are found only in southern and western Ireland and in northern Spain and Portugal but which are absent from intervening countries, represents one of the classic conundrums of biogeography. The aim of the present study was to determine whether the distribution of the Lusitanian plant species Daboecia cantabrica was due to persistence in separate Irish and Iberian refugia, or has resulted from post-glacial recolonization followed by subsequent extinction of intervening populations. Location Northern Spain and Co. Galway, western Ireland. Methods Palaeodistribution modelling using Maxent was employed to iden- tify putative refugial areas for D. cantabrica at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Phylogeographical analysis of samples from 64 locations in Ireland and Spain were carried out using a chloroplast marker (atpB\u2013rbcL), the nuclear ITS region, and an anonymous nuclear single-copy locus. Results The palaeodistribution model indicated areas with a high probability of survival for D. cantabrica at the LGM off the western coast of Galicia in Spain, and in the Bay of Biscay. Spanish populations exhibited substantially higher genetic diversity than Irish populations at all three loci, as well as geo- graphical structuring of haplotypes within Spain consistent with divergence in separate refugia. Spanish populations also exhibited far more endemic haplo- types. Divergence time between Irish and Spanish populations associated with the putative Biscay refugium was estimated as 3.333\u201332 ka. Main conclusions Our data indicate persistence by D. cantabrica throughout the LGM in two separate southern refugia: one in western Galicia and one in the area off the coast of western France which now lies in the Bay of Biscay. Spain was recolonized from both refugia, whilst Ireland was most likely recol- onized from the Biscay refugium. On the balance of evidence across the three marker types and the palaeodistribution modelling, our findings do not sup- port the idea of in situ survival of D. cantabrica in Ireland, contrary to earlier suggestions. The fact that we cannot conclusively rule out the existence of a small, more northerly refugium, however, highlights the need for further analy- sis of Lusitanian plant species.","uuid":"3d43665e-8b9d-396d-b0cf-43f2d296346a","authors":[{"forename":"Gemma E.","surname":"Beatty"},{"forename":"Jim","surname":"Provan"}],"editors":[{"forename":"Hans-Peter","surname":"Comes"}],"publication_outlet":"Journal of Biogeography","firstAuthor":"Beatty"},{"id":"6016481814","title":"A Battle Lost?

Lantana camara L., a shrub native to the American tropics, has become one of the worst weeds in recorded history. In Australia, India and South Africa, Lantana has become very widespread occupying millions of hectares of land. Here, we examine historical records to reconstruct invasion and management of Lantana over two centuries and ask: Can we fight the spread of invasive species or do we need to develop strategies for their adaptive management? We carried out extensive research of historical records constituting over 75% of records on invasion and management of this species in the three countries. The records indicate that governments in Australia, India and South Africa have taken aggressive measures to eradicate Lantana over the last two centuries, but these efforts have been largely unsuccessful. We found that despite control measures, the invasion trajectory of Lantana has continued upwards and that post-war land-use change might have been a possible trigger for this spread. A large majority of studies on invasive species address timescales of less than one year; and even fewer address timescales of >10 years. An understanding of species invasions over long time-scales is of paramount importance. While archival records may give only a partial picture of the spread and management of invasive species, in the absence of any other long-term dataset on the ecology of Lantana, our study provides an important insight into its invasion, spread and management over two centuries and across three continents. While the established paradigm is to expend available resources on attempting to eradicate invasive species, our findings suggest that in the future, conservationists will need to develop strategies for their adaptive management rather than fighting a losing battle.","uuid":"18dff1f8-0fba-3fe4-ae6d-7a021b94458e","authors":[{"forename":"Shonil A.","surname":"Bhagwat"},{"forename":"Elinor","surname":"Breman"},{"forename":"Tarsh","surname":"Thekaekara"},{"forename":"Thomas F.","surname":"Thornton"},{"forename":"Katherine J.","surname":"Willis"}],"editors":[{"forename":"Anna","surname":"Traveset"}],"publication_outlet":"PLoS ONE","firstAuthor":"Bhagwat"},{"id":"6016484864","title":"Leaf evolution in Southern Hemisphere conifers tracks the angiosperm ecological radiation.","type":"Journal Article","volume":"279","issue":"1727","url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21653584\nhttp:\/\/rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org\/content\/279\/1727\/341","tags":["2012","AU","Australia","ecology","GB","GBIF_used","Global_biodiversity","university"],"keywords":["divergence time estimates","molecular phylogeny","plant evolution","Podocarpaceae"],"pages":"314-348","year":"2012","abstract":"The angiosperm radiation has been linked to sharp declines in gymnosperm diversity and the virtual elimination of conifers from the tropics. The conifer family Podocarpaceae stands as an exception with highest species diversity in wet equatorial forests. It has been hypothesized that efficient light harvesting by the highly flattened leaves of several podocarp genera facilitates persistence with canopy-forming angiosperms, and the angiosperm ecological radiation may have preferentially favoured the diversification of these lineages. To test these ideas, we develop a molecular phylogeny for Podocarpaceae using Bayesian-relaxed clock methods incorporating fossil time constraints. We find several independent origins of flattened foliage types, and that these lineages have diversified predominantly through the Cenozoic and therefore among canopy-forming angiosperms. The onset of sustained foliage flattening podocarp diversification is coincident with a declining diversification rate of scale\/needle-leaved lineages and also with ecological and climatic transformations linked to angiosperm foliar evolution. We demonstrate that climatic range evolution is contingent on the underlying state for leaf morphology. Taken together, our findings imply that as angiosperms came to dominate most terrestrial ecosystems, competitive interactions at the foliar level have profoundly shaped podocarp geography and as a consequence, rates of lineage diversification.","uuid":"a08f36f2-daeb-3eaf-bdda-7d69853ad11d","authors":[{"forename":"Ed","surname":"Biffin"},{"forename":"Timothy J.","surname":"Brodribb"},{"forename":"Robert S.","surname":"Hill"},{"forename":"Philip","surname":"Thomas"},{"forename":"Andrew J.","surname":"Lowe"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Biffin"},{"id":"6016484734","title":"Modelling geographic distribution and detecting conservation gaps in Italy for the threatened beetle Rosalia alpina","type":"Journal Article","volume":"online","url":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S1617138112001021","tags":["2012","Aichi_C","conservation","GB","GBIF_used","GBits_32","IT","Italy","Italy_biodiversity","Portugal","PT","Target_11"],"keywords":["Biodiversity","Forest management","Fragmentation","Gap analysis","Insect conservation","IUCN","Maxent","Natura 2000","Saproxylic beetles"],"year":"2012","publisher":"Elsevier GmbH.","abstract":"Presence-only models can aid conservation and management of threatened, elusive species.

Within problem formulation, the insecticidal trait, the crop, the receiving environment, and protection goals were characterized, and a conceptual model was developed to identify routes through which aquatic organisms may be exposed to insecticidal proteins in maize tissue. Following a tiered approach for exposure assessment, worst-case exposures were estimated using standardized models, and factors mitigating exposure were described. Based on exposure estimates, shredders were identified as the functional group most likely to be exposed to insecticidal proteins. However, even using worst-case assumptions, the exposure of shredders to Bt maize was low and studies supporting the current risk assessments were deemed adequate. Determining if early tier toxicity studies are necessary to inform the risk assessment for a specific GM crop should be done on a case by case basis, and should be guided by thorough problem formulation and exposure assessment. The processes used to develop the Bt maize case study are intended to serve as a model for performing risk assessments on future traits and crops.","uuid":"e35486bb-9372-3f20-8e6f-cc24005e31e4","authors":[{"forename":"Keri","surname":"Carstens"},{"forename":"Jennifer","surname":"Anderson"},{"forename":"Pamela","surname":"Bachman"},{"forename":"Adinda","surname":"De Schrijver"},{"forename":"Galen","surname":"Dively"},{"forename":"Brian","surname":"Federici"},{"forename":"Mick","surname":"Hamer"},{"forename":"Marco","surname":"Gielkens"},{"forename":"Peter","surname":"Jensen"},{"forename":"William","surname":"Lamp"},{"forename":"Stefan","surname":"Rauschen"},{"forename":"Geoff","surname":"Ridley"},{"forename":"J\u00f6rg","surname":"Romeis"},{"forename":"Annabel","surname":"Waggoner"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Transgenic Research","firstAuthor":"Carstens"},{"id":"6016481424","title":"Biogeographical patterns of variation in Western European populations of the great green bush-cricket (Tettigonia viridissima; Orthoptera Tettigoniidae)","type":"Journal Article","url":"http:\/\/www.springerlink.com\/index\/10.1007\/s10841-012-9525-9","tags":["2012","Aichi_E","GB","GBIF_used","GB_biodiversity","Target_19"],"keywords":["bush-crickets \u00e1 morphology \u00e1","divergence \u00e1 flight \u00e1","genetic","male calling \u00e1 european"],"year":"2012","abstract":"The great green bush-cricket, Tettigonia viri- dissima, is at the northern limits of its geographic distri- bution in the UK and has suffered a significant reduction in population abundance and range over the last 50 years, now being largely confined to the southern UK.

Location Macaronesia, Mediterranean, Atlantic fringe of Europe. Methods Patterns of genetic diversity are described based on variation at two chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) loci and one nuclear DNA (nDNA) locus for 109 accessions across the entire distribution range of the species. Global patterns of genetic differentiation were investigated using principal coordinates analysis. Genetic differentiation between island and continental areas, estimations of pollen- and seed-mediated gene flow, and the presence of phylogeographical signal were assessed by means of Fst\/NST (continental scale) and Fij\/Nij (local scale). Extant and past distribution ranges of the species were inferred from niche modelling using layers describing present and Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) macroclimatic conditions. Results The Azores exhibited a significantly higher genetic diversity than the continent. The lowest levels of genetic differentiation were observed between the Azores and the western Mediterranean, and the diversity observed in the Azores resulted from at least two colonization waves. Within the Azores, kinship coefficients showed a significant and much steeper decrease with geographical distance in the cpDNA than in the nDNA. The distribution predicted by LGM models was markedly different from the current potential distribution, particularly in western Europe, where no suitable areas were predicted by LGM models, and along the Atlantic coast of the African continent, where LGM models predicted highly suitable climatic conditions. Main conclusions The higher diversity observed in Azorean than in continental populations is inconsistent with MacArthur and Wilson\u2019s equilibrium model and derived theoretical population genetic expectations. This inverted pattern may be the result of extinction on the continent coupled with multiple island colonization events and subsequent allopatric diversification and lineage hybridization in the Azores. The results highlight the role of allopatric diversification in explaining diversification on islands and suggest that this process has played a much more significant role in shaping Azorean biodiversity than previously thought.","uuid":"29778d10-33ff-3fe2-a049-6c1e6afc42ee","authors":[{"forename":"Aur\u00e9lie","surname":"D\u00e9samor\u00e9"},{"forename":"B.","surname":"Laenen"},{"forename":"Juana-Mar\u00eda","surname":"Gonz\u00e1lez-Mancebo"},{"forename":"R.","surname":"Ja\u00e9n Molina"},{"forename":"Nadia","surname":"Bystriakova"},{"forename":"E.","surname":"Martinez-Klimova"},{"forename":"M.

In order to mitigate the impacts of these disturbances, it is important to understand their potential effects on the distributions of species. In the tropics, such understanding has been hindered by poor knowledge of the current distributions and range limits of most species. Here we use herbarium collection records to model the current and future distributions of ca 3000 Amazonian plant species. We project these distributions into the future under a range of different scenarios related to the magnitude and extent of disturbance as well as the response of species to changes in temperature, precipitation and atmospheric concentrations of CO2. We find that the future of Amazonian diversity will be dependant primarily on the ability of species to tolerate or adapt to rising temperatures. If the thermal niches of tropical plants are fixed and incapable of expanding under rapid warming, then the negative effects of climate change will overshadow the effects of deforestation, greatly reducing the area of suitable habitat available to most species and potentially leading to massive losses of biodiversity throughout the Amazon. If tropical species are generally capable of tolerating warmer temperatures, rates of habitat loss will be greatly reduced but many parts of Amazonia may still experience rapid losses of diversity, with the effects of enhanced seasonal water stress being similar in magnitude to the effects of deforestation.","uuid":"db36e222-7992-3580-bd8b-fd2718617e00","authors":[{"forename":"Kenneth J.","surname":"Feeley"},{"forename":"Yadvinder","surname":"Malhi"},{"forename":"Przemyslaw","surname":"Zelazowski"},{"forename":"Miles R.","surname":"Silman"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Global Change Biology","firstAuthor":"Feeley"},{"id":"6016484624","title":"Thinking spatially: The importance of geospatial techniques for carnivore conservation","type":"Journal Article","url":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S157495411200115X","tags":["2012","Aichi_C","conservation","GB","GBIF_used","GBIF_VIP","GBits_32","GIS","mammals","Target_12"],"keywords":["Carnivore","GIS","Landscape ecology","Modelling","Multivariate statistics","Remote-sensing"],"year":"2012","publisher":"Elsevier B.V.","abstract":"Today, 27% of the known mammalian carnivore species are either extinct or threatened, undermining the health of many ecosystems, which provide resources and services that are crucial for human development.

It has been proposed that, across broad spatial scales, climatic factors are the main drivers of ecological patterns, while biotic factors are mainly important at local spatial scales. However, few tests of the effect of biotic interactions on broad-scale patterns have been conducted; conclusions about the scale-dependence of the importance of biotic interactions thus seem premature. 2. We developed an extensive database of locality records of one of Africa\u2019s most conspicuous groups, the acacias (the genera Senegalia and Vachellia), and used species distribution models (SDMs) to estimate the distribution of all African acacias. 3. African acacias are particularly well adapted against mammalian herbivory; therefore, we hypothesized that browser diversity could be an important driver of acacia richness. Species richness maps for the two genera were created from SDM-generated maps. Ordinary least square (OLS) regressions and, to consider spatial autocorrelation, simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) analyses were used to model richness of the two genera in relation to mammalian browser richness, current environment (including climate), and climate history since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). We used variation partitioning to determine what percentage of variation could be explained by these three groups of factors. 4. Both genera showed centres of richness in East Africa and the Limpopo Basin of southern Africa. Browser richness was the best explanatory variable for richness of both genera. Environmental factors explained negligible variation in the richness of Senegalia, but some variation in Vachellia. For both genera, the residuals of the species richness model of one genus also explained much variation in the richness of the other genus, indicating that common factors not considered in the richness analyses here may additionally be driving the richness of both genera. 5. Mechanisms that could generate a correlation between browser and acacia richness are proposed, and differences in the determinants of richness patterns of Senegalia and Vachellia discussed in the light of the two genera\u2019s history of colonization of Africa. 6. Synthesis. This is the first study that demonstrates that consumer diversity can influence richness patterns at continental scales and demonstrates that biotic factors can drive richness even at broad spatial scales.","uuid":"228da240-ac7d-38e1-a818-59d79b3555c5","authors":[{"forename":"Michelle","surname":"Greve"},{"forename":"Anne Mette","surname":"Lykke"},{"forename":"Christopher W.","surname":"Fagg"},{"forename":"Jan","surname":"Bogaert"},{"forename":"Ib","surname":"Friis"},{"forename":"Rob","surname":"Marchant"},{"forename":"Andrew R.","surname":"Marshall"},{"forename":"Brody S.","surname":"Sandel"},{"forename":"Christopher","surname":"Sandom"},{"forename":"Marco","surname":"Schmidt"},{"forename":"Jonathan R.","surname":"Timberlake"},{"forename":"Jan J.","surname":"Wieringa"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Greve"},{"id":"6016484044","title":"You're so vein: bundle sheath physiology, phylogeny and evolution in C3 and C4 plants.","type":"Journal Article","issue":"online","url":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/j.1365-3040.2012.02585.x\nhttp:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22827921","tags":["2012","Aichi_E","evolution","evolutionary ecology","GB","GBIF_used","GBIF_VIP","Global_biodiversity","in_press","plants","Target_19","University of Cambridge"],"keywords":["bundle sheath","cavitation repair","conductance","hydraulic","inter vein distance","mesophyll ratio"],"year":"2012","abstract":"Bundle sheath (BS) anatomy is found in most C4 lineages, associated with low inter-veinal distances (IVD) and high BS:mesophyll ratio (BS:MC).

Suggested functions for BS have included structural support, hydraulic isolation, storage for water, ions, and carbohydrates, and photorespiratory carbon metabolism; we propose a central role for cavitation repair, consistent with the BS as a control centre on regulating stem and leaf hydraulic continuity. An analysis of BS traits in the phylogenetic lineages giving rise to C4 grasses (the 'PACMAD' clade) shows an initial enhancement in BS:MC ratio in C3 lineages, although IVD is similar to the Pooideae sister group. Using a global database, a well-developed BS in the C3 PACMAD lineages was associated with higher precipitation and temperatures in the habitat of origin on an annual basis, with the C3 to C4 progression defined by the aridity index (AI). Maintaining leaf hydraulic conductance and cavitation repair are consistent with increased evaporative demand and more seasonal precipitation as drivers, first for the C3 BS, and then C4 diversification, under declining CO(2) concentrations in the Palaeogene and Neogene.","uuid":"e80505a0-97ef-3539-b05f-db12e1148c0b","authors":[{"forename":"Howard","surname":"Griffiths"},{"forename":"George","surname":"Weller"},{"forename":"Lydia F.

With regards to elevational changes, most studies have either re-sampled historical systematic survey sites or analyzed time series of occurrence data at long-term study sites. Such data sources are unavailable for most tropical mountains, so other methods of detecting elevational changes must be sought. Here we combine data from published checklists, recent fi eld work, peer-reviewed literature, unpublished reports, birdwatchers\u2019 trip reports, databases of birdwatchers\u2019 observations, audio recordings, and photographs to compare historical (pre-1998) and current (post-2006) bird distributions on Mt. Kinabalu in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. Records were carefully checked by experts on Bornean birds. More species are now known from Mt. Kinabalu, but historical data provided elevational range estimates for more species than current data because of extensive mountain-wide collections and surveys. Most elevational comparisons for this study had to be limited to the 1450\u20131900 m elevational band, where most of the recent work has been done. Information was compiled into an annotated list of 342 species from 200\u20134095 m. We present this list to encourage refi nement of the dataset and future work on elevational distributions on the mountain. Of 58 species with suffi cient data from 1450 m to the summit, 38 appear to have shifted their ranges (24 species upslope and 14 downslope). A total of 22 resident species have recently been observed above their published maximum elevation for Borneo. Some species that have shifted upwards, such as Chalcophaps indica and Pellorneum pyrrogenys, are now common or breeding at elevations above their published maximum. Fifteen species appear to have declined on the mountain, probably as a result of habitat loss outside the protected area. Several of the upslope shifts are probably attributable to climate change, but many downslope shifts may be artifacts of incomplete recent sampling. The upward shifts agree with the few other tropical range comparisons that have been published. Our approach demonstrates the viability of combining diverse data sources (of varying accuracy and bias) to detect distributional shifts from climate change.","uuid":"69f5e77e-38de-3dba-be86-a0ad5be784ff","authors":[{"forename":"J Berton C.","surname":"Harris"},{"forename":"Ding Li","surname":"Yong"},{"forename":"Frederick H.","surname":"Sheldon"},{"forename":"Andy J.","surname":"Boyce"},{"forename":"James A.","surname":"Eaton"},{"forename":"Henry","surname":"Bernard"},{"forename":"Alim","surname":"Biun"},{"forename":"Angela","surname":"Langevin"},{"forename":"Thomas E.","surname":"Martin"},{"forename":"Dan","surname":"Wei"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"The Raffles Bulletin of Zoology","firstAuthor":"Harris"},{"id":"6016483194","title":"Clonality Despite Sex: The Evolution of Host-Associated Sexual Neighborhoods in the Pathogenic Fungus Penicillium marneffei","type":"Journal Article","volume":"8","issue":"10","url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.ppat.1002851","tags":["2012","AU","Australia","China","Chinese Taipei","CN","GB","GBIF_used","GBIF_VIP","HK","Hong Kong","human health","IN","India","Taiwan","TH","Thailand","TW","US","Vietnam","Vietnam_biodiversity","VN"],"keywords":[],"pages":"e1002851","year":"2012","uuid":"65109d26-c5e7-3095-96e8-57a3c570a0c3","authors":[{"forename":"Daniel A.","surname":"Henk"},{"forename":"Revital","surname":"Shahar-Golan"},{"forename":"Khuraijam Ranjana","surname":"Devi"},{"forename":"Kylie J.","surname":"Boyce"},{"forename":"Nengyong","surname":"Zhan"},{"forename":"Natalie D.","surname":"Fedorova"},{"forename":"William C.","surname":"Nierman"},{"forename":"Po-Ren","surname":"Hsueh"},{"forename":"Kwok-Yung","surname":"Yuen"},{"forename":"Tran P.

Specifically, AquaMaps, Maxent and the Sea Around Us Project algorithm are three approaches that have been applied to predict distributions of marine fishes and invertebrates. They were designed to cope with issues of data quality and quantity common in species distribution modelling, and especially per- tinent to the marine environment. However, the characteristics of model projections for marine species from these different approaches have rarely been compared. Such comparisons provide information about the robustness and uncertainty of the projections, and are thus important for spatial planning and developing management and conservation strategies. Here we apply the three commonly used species distribution modelling methods for commercial fish in the North Sea and North Atlantic, with the aim of drawing comparisons between the approaches. The effect of different assumptions within each approach on the predicted current relative habitat suitability was assessed. Predicted current distributions were tested following data partitioning and selection of pseudoabsences from within a specified distance of occurrence data. As indicated by the test statistics, each modelling method produced plausible predic- tions of relative habitat suitability for each species, with subsequent incorporation of expert knowledge generally improving predictions. However, because of the differences between modelling algorithms, methodologies and patterns of relative suitability, comparing models using test statistics and selecting a \u2018best\u2019 model are not recommended.

A possibility for the lack of a relationship between PLD and range size may stem from the failure of past studies to account for the eff ect of species evolutionary ages, which may add to the dispersal capabilities of species. However, if dispersal over ecological (i.e. PLD) and across evolutionary (i.e. species evolutionary age) time scales continues to show no eff ect on range size then an outstanding question is why? Here we collected data on PLD, evolutionary ages and range sizes of seven tropical fish families (five families were reef-associated and two have dwell demersal habitats) to explore the independent and interactive effects of PLD and evolutionary age on range size. Separate analyses on each family showed that even after controlling for evolutionary age, PLD has an insignificant or a very small effect on range size. To shed light on why dispersal has such a limited effect on range size, we developed a global ocean circulation model to quantify the connectivity among tropical reefs relative to the potential dispersal conferred by PLD. We found that although there are several areas of great isolation in the tropical oceans, most reef habitats are within the reach of most species given their PLDs. These results suggest that the lack of habitat isolation can potentially render the constraining effect of dispersal on range size insignificant and explain why dispersal does not relate to range size in reef fishes.","uuid":"158bd6c8-475d-3459-bcb9-1a8b97b39603","authors":[{"forename":"Camilo","surname":"Mora"},{"forename":"Eric A.","surname":"Treml"},{"forename":"Jason","surname":"Roberts"},{"forename":"Kate","surname":"Crosby"},{"forename":"Denis","surname":"Roy"},{"forename":"Derek P.","surname":"Tittensor"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Ecography","firstAuthor":"Mora"},{"id":"6016483524","title":"First record of the onion psyllid Bactericera tremblayi (Wagner, 1961) in France (Insecta: Hemiptera: Sternorrhyncha: Psylloidea), new symptoms on leek crops and reassessment of the B. nigricornis -group distribution","type":"Journal Article","volume":"42","issue":"3","url":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/epp.12005","tags":["2012","Aichi_B","CH","France_biodiversity","GB","GBIF_used","GBits_32","Global_biodiversity","invasive","Switzerland","Target_9"],"keywords":[],"pages":"585-590","year":"2012","abstract":"The triozid Bactericera tremblayi, or onion psyllid, is recorded for the first time from France, and is associated for the first time with important damage on leek crops in several regions of the country.

Here, we examine the phylogeographic structure of a widespread and economically important tree, Cordia alliodora, to: (1) test the roles of vicariance and dispersal in establishing major range disjunctions, (2) determine which geographic regions and\/or habitats contain the highest levels of genetic diversity, and (3) infer the geographic origin of the species. Location: Twenty-five countries in Central and South America, and the West Indies. Methods: Chloroplast simple sequence repeats (cpSSR; eight loci) were assayed in 67 populations (240 individuals) sampled from the full geographic range of C. alliodora. Chloroplast (trnH\u2013psbA) and nuclear (internal transcribed spacer, ITS) DNA sequences were sampled from a geographically representative subset. Genetic structure was determined with samova, structure and haplotype networks. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) and rarefaction analyses were used to compare regional haplotype diversity and differentiation. Results Although the ITS region was polymorphic it revealed limited phylogeographic structure, and trnH\u2013psbA was monomorphic. However, structure analysis of cpSSR variation recovered three broad demes spanning Central America (Deme 1), the Greater Antilles and the Choc\u00f3 (Deme 2), and the Lesser Antilles and cis-Andean South America (Deme 3). samova showed two predominant demes (Deme 1 + 2 and Deme 3). The greatest haplotype diversity was detected east of the Andes, while significantly more genetic variation was partitioned among trans-Andean populations. Populations experiencing high precipitation seasonality (dry ecotype) had greater levels of genetic variation. Main conclusions Cordia alliodora displayed weak cis- and trans-Andean phylogeographic structure based on DNA sequence data, indicative of historical dispersal around this barrier and genetic exchange across its broad range. The cpSSR data revealed phylogeographic structure corresponding to three biogeographic zones. Patterns of genetic diversity are indicative of an origin in the seasonally dry habitats of South America. Therefore, C. alliodora fits the disperser hypothesis for widespread Neotropical species. Dispersal is evident in the West Indies and the northern Andean cordilleras. The dry ecotype harbours genetic variation that is likely to represent the source for the establishment of populations under future warmer and drier climatic scenarios.","uuid":"b6f163af-a513-3bc1-acfb-e8fc76d5e1b7","authors":[{"forename":"Paul D.","surname":"Rymer"},{"forename":"Christopher W.","surname":"Dick"},{"forename":"Giovanni G.","surname":"Vendramin"},{"forename":"Anna","surname":"Buonamici"},{"forename":"David","surname":"Boshier"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Journal of Biogeography","firstAuthor":"Rymer"},{"id":"6016483724","title":"Distribution of \u2018Candidatus Phytoplasma prunorum\u2019 and its vector Cacopsylla pruni in European fruit-growing areas: a review","type":"Journal Article","volume":"42","issue":"2","url":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/epp.2567","tags":["2012","agriculture","Aichi_B","AT","Austria","disease","Europe_biodiversity","FR","France","GB","GBIF_used","invasive","Target_9"],"keywords":[],"pages":"191-202","year":"2012","abstract":"European stone fruit yellows (ESFY) is an EU-listed I\/AII disease affecting Prunus spp. caused by \u2018Candidatus Phytoplasma prunorum\u2019. This paper reports the results from a systematic literature review approach that sought to determine the geographic distribution of \u2018Ca. Phytoplasma prunorum\u2019 in European fruit-growing areas. Evidence for the presence of the phytoplasma was found for 15 of the 27 EU countries. It is prevalent in the most important stone fruit production areas of Central and Southern Europe, where it causes substantial impact in apricots (Prunus armeniaca), Japanese plums (P. salicina) and peaches (P. persica). In Northern European areas where these hosts are not produced, it is occasion- ally found on tolerant species (P. domestica). However, because surveys of the disease sta- tus of tolerant hosts are not performed, it remains unclear whether the pathogen is absent in Northern Europe or survives in tolerant cultivated or wild hosts. No reports of ESFY were found from the southernmost part of Europe: Portugal, Spain (Andalucia, Castile\u2013La Man- cha), Italy (Sicily, Puglia), Greece (Crete), Cyprus and Malta. This may be explained by the absence of the favoured wild hosts of the vector. Moreover, it remains unclear if the vector finds suitable conditions for aestivation and overwintering in these regions. Introduction European stone fruit yellows (EFSY) is an important disease affecting Prunus spp., which is caused by \u2018Candida- tus Phytoplasma prunorum\u2019. This pathogen is currently reg- ulated in Annex I\/AII of the EC directive 2000\/29 as \u2018apricot chlorotic leafroll mycoplasma\u2019 and requirements for the movement of Prunus plants are set out in Annex IV. ESFY symptoms were first observed in France on apri- \u00b4pe cot (P. armeniaca), and described as \u2018de \u00b4rissement de l\u2019abricotier par apoplexie\u2019 (Chabrolin, 1924). Then \u2018plum leptonecrosis\u2019 (PLN) was described on Japanese plum (P. salicina) in Italy (Goida `nich, 1934). In 1965, Morvan and Castelain named the disease \u2018enroulement chlorotique de l\u2019abricotier\u2019 (ECA) (\u2018apricot chlorotic leafroll\u2019, ACLR). Symptoms of \u2018peach yellowing\u2019 were also associated with severe declines on P. persica (Poggi Pollini et al., 1993). Finally, all these symptoms on Prunus have been associ- ated with genetically very similar phytoplasma, and the name \u2018European stone fruit yellows\u2019 was proposed for the disease (Lorenz et al., 1994). Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the ESFY agent is closely related to the Pear Decline and Apple Proliferation pathogens, constitut- ing the 16SrX group, and the name \u2018Candidatus Phytopl- asma prunorum\u2019 was proposed (Seemu 2004). \u00a8ller & Schneider, Symptoms of ESFY are obvious only in P. armeniaca, P. salicina and P. persica, whereas other important stone fruit species are either tolerant, usually not showi","uuid":"a689325d-6a01-3f17-b1e6-517db2c852cc","authors":[{"forename":"R.","surname":"Steffek"},{"forename":"Swen","surname":"Follak"},{"forename":"N.","surname":"Sauvion"},{"forename":"G.","surname":"Labonne"},{"forename":"A.","surname":"MacLeod"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Steffek"},{"id":"6016483224","title":"Assessing the Congruence of Thermal Niche Estimations Derived from Distribution and Physiological Data.

Several morphological features interpreted as adaptations to drought are found in the clade, and many species occupy extremely dry habitats. Recent phylogenetic analyses have shown that the sister group of this clade is Potentilla section Rivales, a group with distinct moist habitat preferences. This has led to the hypothesis that the ivesioids (genera Ivesia, Horkelia and Horkeliella) diversified in response to the late Tertiary aridification of western North America. We used phyloclimatic modeling and a fossil-calibrated dated phylogeny of the family Rosaceae to investigate the evolution of the ivesioid clade. We have combined occurrence- and climate data from extant species, and used ancestral state reconstruction to model past climate preferences. These models have been projected into paleo-climatic scenarios in order to identify areas where the ivesioids may have occurred. Our analysis suggests a split between the ivesioids and Potentilla sect.

Our model was based mostly on climatic variables and predicts a high suitability for most eastern Africa countries south of the equator, but none of the western African countries with the exception of Angola and Namibia. Both the actual number of records as well as the distribution model thus indicates that the vast majority of Corncrakes migrate through and overwinter in the eastern parts of Africa. Because large parts of Angola, Mozambique, north-eastern Namibia, and Tanzania are predicted as suitable but have yielded very few actual records so far, they should be targeted for future field work. A very small number of Corncrakes may oversummer in Africa but such individuals are possibly unable to migrate due to sickness or injury, or may be first-year birds that are not ready to breed. An analysis of habitat and population density data indicates that, within the continental distribution, Corncrakes are mostly concentrated within grass-dominated habitats, mirroring their habitat preferences in the breeding areas. Corncrakes reach their wintering distribution mostly through an eastern migration route, but some individuals or subpopulations from the Western breeding population also use a western migration route. We also document the food choices, weights, and causes of injury and death within Africa. Because habitat conversion is accelerating all across Africa, we recommend constant monitoring of habitat availability and population densities within the Corncrake\u2019s wintering distribution.","uuid":"0419a91b-8795-3f72-8257-5767a66d491c","authors":[{"forename":"Bruno A.","surname":"Walther"},{"forename":"P.","surname":"Barry Taylor"},{"forename":"Norbert","surname":"Sch\u00e4ffer"},{"forename":"Sue","surname":"Robinson"},{"forename":"Frederic Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric","surname":"Jiguet"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Bird Conservation International","firstAuthor":"Walther"},{"id":"6016483244","title":"Late Quaternary environmental and landscape dynamics revealed by a pingo sequence on the northern Seward Peninsula , Alaska","type":"Journal Article","volume":"39","url":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.quascirev.2012.01.027","tags":["2012","Arctic_biodiversity","DE","GB","GBIF_used","Germany","museum","paleobiogeography","RU","Russia","university","US"],"keywords":["Central Beringia","holocene thermal maximum","Picea sp.","Pingo","Spruce","Thermokarst"],"pages":"26-44","year":"2012","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","abstract":"A terrestrial sediment sequence exposed in an eroding pingo provides insights into the late-Quaternary environmental history of the northern Seward Peninsula, Alaska.

High values of Picea pollen and the presence of Larix pollen in sediments dated to 50\u201340 ka BP strongly suggest the presence of forest or woodland early in MIS 3; the trees grew within a vegetation matrix dominated by grass and sedge, and there is indirect evidence of grazing animals.

An early Holocene warm period is indicated by renewed thermokarst lake formation and a range of fossil taxa. Multiple extralimital plant taxa suggest mean July temperatures above modern values. The local presence of spruce during the early Holocene warm interval is evident from a radiocarbon-dated spruce macrofossil remain and indicates significant range extension far beyond the modern tree line.

Faunal abundance, species richness, species diversity, and proportion of rare species were relatively uniform along the Channel, as were faunal abundance, species diversity and proportion of rare species down the shore. Overall species richness per station, however, was significantly lower at LWN than at either MLW or LWS, although the distribution of species richness over the shore did not depart from random at one of the three sites. Overall faunal abundance and those of individual component species were dispersed patchily through the bed. The nature of the faunal assemblages present, however, varied significantly throughout the bed, both along the Channel at each shore-height horizon, and down the shore at each site. LWN assemblages formed a unit distinct from those at MLW and LWS. Overall, the shore-height axis accounted for 47% and the along-shore axis 28% of total assemblage variation. Faunal assemblages were randomly structured at each nodal intersection point of the down-shore and along-shore axes, but were significantly non-randomly assembled down the shore at each site and along the Channel at each shore-height horizon except at the LWN level. Components of total assemblage variance were largest at the smallest scale investigated (1 m). Higher seagrass horizons are not just progressively more impoverished versions of lower ones and although macrofaunal assemblage composition is heavily influenced by shore height much of the ecological structure of faunal assemblages seems little affected by tidal horizon. These findings are discussed in relation to conservation of the vulnerable seagrass Nanozostera capensis at Knysna, a system affected by subsistence exploitation of its intertidal benthic invertebrates.","uuid":"29c30bd0-9446-355e-8075-c3385c801e95","authors":[{"forename":"R.

Location North America: Pacific Northwest and north-eastern USA\/south-eastern Canada. Methods Palaeodistribution modelling was carried out to determine suitable climatic regions for M. hypopitys at the LGM. We analysed between 155 and 176 individuals from 39 locations spanning the species\u2019 entire range in North America. Sequence data were obtained for the chloroplast rps2 gene (n = 168) and for the nuclear ITS region (n = 158). Individuals were also genotyped for eight microsatellite loci (n = 176). Interpolation of diversity values was used to visualize the range-wide distribution of genetic diversity for each of the three marker classes. Minimum spanning networks were constructed showing the relationships between the rps2 and ITS haplotypes, and the geographical distributions of these haplotypes were plotted. The numbers of genetic clusters based on the microsatellite data were estimated using Bayesian clustering approaches. Results The palaeodistribution modelling indicated suitable climate envelopes for M. hypopitys at the LGM in both the Pacific Northwest and south-eastern USA. High levels of genetic diversity and endemic haplotypes were found in Oregon, the Alexander Archipelago, Wisconsin, and in the south-eastern part of the species\u2019 distribution range. Main conclusions Our results suggest a complex recolonization history for M. hypopitys in North America, involving persistence in separate eastern and western refugia. A generally high degree of congruence between the different marker classes analysed indicated the presence of multiple refugia, with at least two refugia in each area.

Ballast water introductions are thought to have brought them to continental Europe in the early twentieth century. These will have probably been as larvae, which will then have settled in the estuaries subsequently moving upstream as juveniles. The capacity of these crabs to move upstream (and over land) is staggering and indi- viduals in their native range in the Far East have been found more than 1,000 km from the sea, where they must return to breed. A number of successful separate introductions of mitten crabs have taken place in Europe, including the UK and America. Europe (Northern Germany) saw initial introductions in 1912, followed by others into both the North Sea coasts and English Channel coasts of France. The extensive network of Northern European waterways facilitated the spread in river systems. After a lag phase, which is typical of many invasive species following introduction, numbers of mitten crabs increased dramatically such that by 1936 attempts at removing the animals from rivers in Germany were abandoned; some 220 metric tonnes were removed from the River Weser alone in that year. Introductions into the UK (River Thames) followed in the mid-1930s but initial introductions appear not to have founded a population. It was not until 1970s that mitten crabs numbers increased and the Thames population became established, and it has subsequently increased and spread. The crab had spread rapidly both around UK coasts and up river systems by the end of the twentieth century and into the 1st decade of the 21st.

Despite the centrality of species distributions to biodiversity conservation, the demonstrated large migration of tropical plant species in response to climate change in the past, and the expected sensitivity of species distributions to modern climate change, no study has tested for modern species migrations in tropical plants. Here we conduct a first test of the hypothesis that increasing temperatures are causing tropical trees to migrate to cooler areas. Location Tropical Andes biodiversity hotspot, south-eastern Peru, South America. Methods We use data from repeated (2003\/04\u20132007\/08) censuses of 14 1-ha forest inventory plots spanning an elevational gradient from 950 to 3400 m in Manu National Park in south-eastern Peru, to characterize changes in the elevational distributions of 38 Andean tree genera. We also analyse changes in the genus-level composition of the inventory plots through time. Results We show that most tropical Andean tree genera shifted their mean distributions upslope over the study period and that the mean rate of migration is approximately 2.5\u20133.5 vertical metres upslope per year. Consistent with upward migrations we also find increasing abundances of tree genera previously distributed at lower elevations in the majority of study plots. Main conclusions These findings are in accord with the a priori hypothesis of upward shifts in species ranges due to elevated temperatures, and are potentially the first documented evidence of present-day climate-driven migrations in a tropical plant community. The observed mean rate of change is less than predicted from the temperature increases for the region, possibly due to the influence of changes in moisture or non-climatic factors such as substrate, species interactions, lags in tree community response and\/or dispersal limitations. Whatever the cause(s), continued slower-than-expected migration of tropical Andean trees would indicate a limited ability to respond to increased temperatures, which may lead to increased extinction risks with further climate change.","uuid":"60d1493f-ac45-3b46-85e3-4e47f4fac452","authors":[{"forename":"Kenneth J.","surname":"Feeley"},{"forename":"Miles R.","surname":"Silman"},{"forename":"Mark B.","surname":"Bush"},{"forename":"William","surname":"Farfan"},{"forename":"Karina Garcia","surname":"Cabrera"},{"forename":"Yadvinder","surname":"Malhi"},{"forename":"Patrick","surname":"Meir"},{"forename":"Norma Salinas","surname":"Revilla"},{"forename":"Mireya Natividad Raurau","surname":"Quisiyupanqui"},{"forename":"Sassan","surname":"Saatchi"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Journal of Biogeography","firstAuthor":"Feeley"},{"id":"6016478954","title":"Application of bioclimatic models coupled with network analysis for risk assessment of the killer shrimp, Dikerogammarus villosus, in Great Britain","type":"Journal Article","issue":"online","url":"http:\/\/www.springerlink.com\/index\/10.1007\/s10530-011-0154-0","tags":["2011","Aichi_B","ES","GB","GBIF_used","invasive","Spain","Target_9","University of Cambridge"],"keywords":["Aquatic invasive species","Dispersal velocity","Great Ouse River","Species distribution model","Support Vector Machine","Zebra mussel"],"year":"2011","abstract":"In this study we use a combination of techniques to assess the general risk of invasion by the aquatic invader Dikerogammarus villosus in Great Britain at multiple scales. First, bioclimatic models (Support Vector Machine algorithm) were used to identify regions showing the highest climatic match with the European range of the species, and that might be at highest risk of initial colonization if provided with propagules. The model showed that nearly 60% of Great Britain shows the minimum bioclimatic suitability for the species, particularly southern and eastern England. Afterwards, a Network Analysis was used to model the natural spatio-temporal spread of the killer shrimp in the Great Ouse River catchment (SE England), the first region invaded by this species. This model suggested that the northern part of the catchment, including two relevant Ramsar sites (Ouse Washes and Wicken fen) are at serious risk of being invaded in the short-term (<5 years). Taking into account the rapid spread of the killer shrimp in other European countries, its broad environmental tolerance, the high climate suitability of broad areas of Great Britain to the species, the current spread of other Ponto-Caspian species, and the high natural and artificial connectivity of the hydrological network, we conclude that D. villosus is very likely to continue its spread in Great Britain, dramatically affecting the native biodiversity. The multi-scale approach proposed in this study combines large-scale bioclimatic models with local-scale dispersal models, providing managers with a powerful spatial and temporal basis for informed decision-making.","uuid":"600a896b-66dc-3b38-9a81-39f98fa216be","authors":[{"forename":"Belinda","surname":"Gallardo"},{"forename":"M.

The main concerns regarding this plant are that it produces a large amount of highly allergenic pollen that causes high rates of sensitisation among humans, but also A. artemisiifolia is increasingly becoming a major weed in agriculture. Recently, chemical and mechanical control methods have been developed and partially implemented in Europe, but sustainable control strategies to mitigate its spread into areas not yet invaded and to reduce its abundance in badly infested areas are lacking. One management tool, not yet implemented in Europe but successfully applied in Australia, is biological control. Almost all natural enemies that have colonised A. artemisiifolia in Europe are polyphagous and cause little damage, rendering them unsuitable for a system management approach. Two fungal pathogens have been reported to adversely impact A. artemisiifolia in the introduced range, but their biology makes them unsuitable for mass production and application as a mycoherbicide. In the native range of A. artemisiifolia, on the other hand, a number of herbivores and pathogens associated with this plant have a very narrow host range and reduce pollen and seed production, the stage most sensitive for long-term population management of this winter annual. We discuss and propose a prioritisation of these biological control candidates for a classical or inundative biological control approach against A. artemisiifolia in Europe, capitalising on past experiences from North America, Asia and Australia.","uuid":"7491693f-dddd-37ad-bf7d-44ce04272f50","authors":[{"forename":"E.","surname":"Gerber"},{"forename":"U.","surname":"Schaffner"},{"forename":"A.","surname":"Gassmann"},{"forename":"H.

Large user communities are generating significant amounts of valuable environmental observations at local and regional scales using the devices and services of the Future Internet. These communities\u2019 environmental observations represent a wealth of information which is currently hardly used or used only in isolation and therefore in need of integration with other information sources. Indeed, this very integration will lead to a paradigm shift from a mere Sensor Web to an Observation Web with semantically enriched content emanating from sensors, environmental simulations and citizens. The paper also describes the research challenges to realize the Observation Web and the associated environmental enablers for the Future Internet. Such an environmental enabler could for instance be an electronic sensing device, a web-service application, or even a social networking group affording or facilitating the capability of the Future Internet applications to consume, produce, and use environmental observations in cross-domain applications. The term \u2015envirofied\u2016 Future Internet is coined to describe this overall target that forms a cornerstone of work in the Environmental Usage Area within the Future Internet PPP program. Relevant trends described in the paper are the usage of ubiquitous sensors (anywhere), the provision and generation of information by citizens, and the convergence of real and virtual realities to convey understanding of environmental observations. The paper addresses the technical challenges in the Environmental Usage Area and the need for designing multi-style service oriented architecture. Key topics are the mapping of requirements to capabilities, providing scalability and robustness with implementing context aware information retrieval. Another essential research topic is handling data fusion and model based computation, and the related propagation of information uncertainty. Approaches to security, standardization and harmonization, all essential for sustainable solutions, are summarized from the perspective of the Environmental Usage Area. The paper concludes with an overview of emerging, high impact applications in the environmental areas concerning land ecosystems (biodiversity), air quality (atmospheric conditions) and water ecosystems (marine asset management).","uuid":"7add5e71-bdbc-3824-ab74-998a2414de84","authors":[{"forename":"Denis","surname":"Havlik"},{"forename":"Sven","surname":"Schade"},{"forename":"Zoheir A.","surname":"Sabeur"},{"forename":"Paolo","surname":"Mazzetti"},{"forename":"Kym","surname":"Watson"},{"forename":"Arne J.","surname":"Berre"},{"forename":"Jose Lorenzo","surname":"Mon"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Havlik"},{"id":"6016480414","title":"Some Like It Hot: The Influence and Implications of Climate Change on Coffee Berry Borer (Hypothenemus hampei) and Coffee Production in East Africa","type":"Journal Article","volume":"6","issue":"9","url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0024528","tags":["2011","agriculture","climate","DE","GB","GBIF_used","Germany","KE","Kenya","university","US","USDA"],"keywords":[],"pages":"e24528","year":"2011","abstract":"The negative effects of climate change are already evident for many of the 25 million coffee farmers across the tropics and the 90 billion dollar (US) coffee industry.

In order to anticipate threats and prioritize management actions for H. hampei we present here, maps on future distributions of H. hampei in coffee producing areas of East Africa. Using the CLIMEX model we relate present-day insect distributions to current climate and then project the fitted climatic envelopes under future scenarios A2A and B2B (for HADCM3 model).

The calculated hypothetical number of generations per year of H. hampei is predicted to increase in all C. arabica-producing areas from five to ten.

Studies of the effects of different litter species and combinations are rare in tropical forests and absent from African forests. Therefore we investigated: (1) Are there differences in litter decomposition in two forest types differing in tree diversity; and (2) is litter decomposition diversity-dependent? Location: Old-growth moist evergreen tropical forest Dja Faunal Reserve, southeast Cameroon. Methods We calculate decomposition rates (leaf litter fall\/leaf litter standing crop) along a tree diversity gradient in two forest types (naturally occurring low-diversity monodominant and adjacent higher-diversity mixed forest). Both forests experience the same climate on the same soil type; the former is dominated by a single species, Gilbertiodendron dewevrei (De Wild.) J. L\u00e9onard, probably due to lack of a long-term disturbance and has similar edaphic factors. Decomposition experiments were conducted in both forest types using single and mixed species litter bags of standard high-quality (bay leaves; Laurus nobilis L.) and low-quality (G. dewevrei) litter over 9 months. Results The estimated decomposition rate in mixed forest was four times faster than in monodominant forest, and not significantly correlated with local quadrat-scale tree species diversity. The litter bag experiment showed that decomposition of high-quality leaves was faster than low-quality leaves (k values: 2.0 yr\u22121 vs 0.6 yr\u22121). Decay rates for each single species litter type were not significantly different in both forest types. However, G. dewevrei litter in mixed bags decomposed faster than in single-species bags in mixed forest, suggesting an impact of litter mixing on decomposition. In addition, bay litter in mixed bags decomposed faster in mixed than in monodominant forests across the three study sites. Conclusion The observed difference in litter decomposition rate between low-diversity monodominant and adjacent high-diversity forest is more likely due to dominance of low-quality G. dewevrei litter, rather than low-diversity of the litter itself.","uuid":"65d161a8-c8b8-35aa-b809-ac5a7ed9b0cf","authors":[{"forename":"Kelvin S.

To date, however, no consensus has emerged on how these processes will affect the range-wide genetic diversity of impacted species. It has been suggested that species that recolonized from low-latitude refugia might harbour high levels of genetic variation in rear-edge populations, and that loss of these populations could cause a disproportionately large reduction in overall genetic diversity in such taxa. In the present study, we have examined the distribution of genetic diversity across the range of the seaweed Chondrus crispus, a species that has exhibited a northward shift in its southern limit in Europe over the last 40 years. Analysis of 19 populations from both sides of the North Atlantic using mitochondrial single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), sequence data from two single-copy nuclear regions and allelic variation at eight microsatellite loci revealed unique genetic variation for all marker classes in the rear-edge populations in Iberia, but not in the rear-edge populations in North America. Palaeodistribution modelling and statistical testing of alternative phylogeographic scenarios indicate that the unique genetic diversity in Iberian populations is a result not only of persistence in the region during the last glacial maximum, but also because this refugium did not contribute substantially to the recolonization of Europe after the retreat of the ice. Consequently, loss of these rear-edge populations as a result of ongoing climate change will have a major effect on the overall genetic diversity of the species, particularly in Europe, and this could compromise the adaptive potential of the species as a whole in the face of future global warming.","uuid":"d13b3e0c-9ae2-357d-ac3b-f9f29a73fb96","authors":[{"forename":"Jim","surname":"Provan"},{"forename":"Christine A.","surname":"Maggs"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Proceedings.

Within South America diversity is not distributed evenly at both local and continental scales and this has led to the recognition of various areas with unique species assemblages. Several schemes currently exist which divide the continental-level diversity into large species assemblages referred to as biomes. Here we review five currently available biome maps for South America, including the WWF Ecoregions, the Americas basemap, the Land Cover Map of South America, Morrone\u2019s Biogeographic regions of Latin America, and the Ecological Systems Map. The comparison is performed through a case study on the Seasonally Dry Tropical Forest (SDTF) biome using herbarium data of habitat specialist species. Results Current biome maps of South America perform poorly in depicting SDTF distribution. The poor performance of the maps can be attributed to two main factors: (1) poor spatial resolution, and (2) poor biome delimitation. Poor spatial resolution strongly limits the use of some of the maps in GIS applications, especially for areas with heterogeneous landscape such as the Andes. Whilst the Land Cover Map did not suffer from poor spatial resolution, it showed poor delimitation of biomes. The results highlight that delimiting structurally heterogeneous vegetation is difficult based on remote sensed data alone. A new refined working map of South American SDTF biome is proposed, derived using the Biome Distribution Modelling (BDM) approach where georeferenced herbarium data is used in conjunction with bioclimatic data. Conclusions Georeferenced specimen data play potentially an important role in biome mapping. Our study shows that herbarium data could be used as a way of ground-truthing biome maps in silico. The results also illustrate that herbarium data can be used to model vegetation maps through predictive modelling. The BDM approach is a promising new method in biome mapping, and could be particularly useful for mapping poorly known, fragmented, or degraded vegetation. We wish to highlight that biome delimitation is not an exact science, and that transparency is needed on how biomes are used as study units in macroevolutionary and ecological research.","uuid":"84e50621-0ab3-384b-a1c3-be04cab594dd","authors":[{"forename":"Tiina","surname":"Sarkinen"},{"forename":"Joao R.

Similar methodology was used for fungal samples identified using morphology from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility to compare data quality and quantity.

However, with the exception of the salmon louse, Lepeophtheirus salmonis, our knowledge of such parasites in commercial species is rudimentary. The current study examines the morphology and pathology of the parasitic copepod, Nicotho\u00eb astaci (the 'lobster louse') in its host, the European lobster, Homarus gammarus. Lobsters were sampled from waters surrounding Lundy Island (Bristol Channel, UK) and all individuals collected were found to harbour female adult N. astaci in their gills, with a mean of 47\u00b73 parasites\/lobster. The majority of N. astaci were found in the basal region of pleurobranch gills. The parasite was found to attach to gill filaments via its oral sucker, maxillae and maxillipeds, and to feed on host haemolymph (blood) through a funnel-like feeding channel. It caused varying degrees of damage to the host gill, including occlusion of gill filaments and disruption to the vascular system in the central axis. Although there was evidence of extensive host response (haemocytic infiltration) to the parasite, it was displaced from the parasite attachment site and thus was observed in the central gill axis below. The region of gill filament immediately underlying the parasite feeding channel was devoid of such activity suggesting that the parasite interferes with the cellular defence and haemostatic mechanisms of the lobster in order to maintain invasion of the host.","uuid":"411a9cbe-3102-3418-acc8-3d9d44b60aca","authors":[{"forename":"Emma C.","surname":"Wootton"},{"forename":"Edward C.","surname":"Pope"},{"forename":"Claire L.","surname":"Vogan"},{"forename":"Emily C.","surname":"Roberts"},{"forename":"Charlotte E.","surname":"Davies"},{"forename":"Andrew F.","surname":"Rowley"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Wootton"},{"id":"6016475404","title":"Distorted views of biodiversity: spatial and temporal bias in species occurrence data","type":"Journal Article","volume":"8","issue":"6","url":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pbio.1000385\nhttp:\/\/www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov\/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2879389&tool=pmcentrez&rendertype=abstract","tags":["2010","Aichi_E","AU","Australia","China","CN","conservation","CSIRO","GB","GBIF_used","GBIF_VIP","global_biodiversity","IUCN Red List","Target_19"],"notes":"\n        <m:bold>From Duplicate 1 ( <\/m:bold>\n        <m:bold><\/m:bold>\n        <m:bold>\n          <m:italic>Distorted Views of Biodiversity: Spatial and Temporal Bias in Species Occurrence Data<\/m:italic>\n        <\/m:bold>\n        <m:bold><\/m:bold>\n        <m:bold> - Boakes, Elizabeth H; McGowan, Philip J K; Fuller, Richard A; Chang-qing, Ding; Clark, Natalie E; O&#039;Connor, Kim; Mace, Georgina M )<m:linebreak><\/m:linebreak>\n        <\/m:bold>\n        <m:linebreak><\/m:linebreak>\n        <m:linebreak><\/m:linebreak>\n        <m:linebreak><\/m:linebreak>\n      ","keywords":["Animals","Biodiversity"],"pages":"e1000385","year":"2010","publisher":"Public Library of Science","abstract":"Boakes et al. compile and analyze a historical dataset of 170,000 bird sightings over two centuries and show how changing trends in data gathering may confound a true picture of biodiversity change.","uuid":"f36647c3-1069-3f8a-a065-6c599dce2f6d","authors":[{"forename":"Elizabeth H.","surname":"Boakes"},{"forename":"Philip J.

In large parts of the world and for the majority of species, data describing distributions are very scarce. Museums, private collections and the historical literature offer a vast source of information on distributions. Records of the occurrence of species from these sources are increasingly being captured in electronic databases and made available over the internet. These records may be very valuable in conservation efforts. However, there are a number of limitations with museum data. These limitations are dealt with in the first part of this review. Even if the limitations of museum data can be overcome, these data present a far-from-complete picture of the distributions of species. Species distribution models offer a means to extrapolate limited information in order to estimate the distributions of species over large areas. The second part of this paper reviews the challenges of developing species distribution models for use with museum data and describes some of the questions that species distribution models have been used to address. Given the rapidly increasing number of museum records of species occurrence available over the internet, a review of their usefulness in conservation and ecology is timely.","uuid":"bcf4b5ef-643f-3802-bad6-6626f18cc9b6","authors":[{"forename":"Tim","surname":"Newbold"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Progress in Physical Geography","firstAuthor":"Newbold"},{"id":"6016476324","title":"On the relationship between a resource based measure of geodiversity and broad scale biodiversity patterns","type":"Journal Article","volume":"19","issue":"9","url":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/s10531-010-9876-z\nhttp:\/\/www.springerlink.com\/index\/10.1007\/s10531-010-9876-z","tags":["2010","conservation","GB","GBIF_used","university"],"keywords":["biodiversity","conservation","environmental diversity","Geodiversity","landscape","modelling","spatial heterogeneity"],"pages":"2751-2766","year":"2010","publisher":"Springer Netherlands","abstract":"Geodiversity, (diversity of the geosphere) incorporates many of the environmental patterns and processes that are considered drivers of biodiversity. Components of geodiversity (climate, topography, geology and hydrology) can be considered in terms of their resource giving potential, where resources are taken as energy, water, space and nutrients. The total amount of these resources, along with their spatial and temporal variation, is herein proposed as a compound index of geodiversity that has the potential to model broad scale biodiversity patterns. This paper outlines potential datasets that could be used to represent geodiversity, and then reviews the theoretical links between each element of the proposed compound index of geodiversity (overall resource availability, temporal variation and spatial variation in those resources) and broad-scale patterns of biodiversity. Support for the influence of each of the elements of geodiversity on overall biodiversity patterns was found in the literature, although the majority of relevant research focuses on resource availability, particularly available energy. The links between temporal and spatial variation in resources and biodiversity have been less thoroughly investigated in the literature. For the most part, it was reported that overall resource availability, temporal variation and spatial variation in those resources do not act in isolation in terms of controlling biodiversity. Overall there are sufficient datasets to calculate the proposed compound index of geodiversity, and evidence in the literature for links between the geographical distribution of biodiversity and each of the elements of the compound index defined. Since data for measuring geodiversity is more spatially consistent and widely available (thanks to satellite remote sensing) geodiversity has potential as a conservation planning tool, especially where biological data are not available or sparsely distributed.","uuid":"668f3c73-b031-3fe3-b453-74cca173e89e","authors":[{"forename":"K.

In the marine environment there is a significant challenge to the production of range maps due to large biases in the amount and location of occurrence data for most species. AquaMaps is compared with traditional presence-only species distribution modelling methods to determine the quality of outputs under equivalently automated conditions. The effect of the inclusion of expert knowledge to AquaMaps is also investigated. Model outputs were tested internally, through data partitioning, and externally against independent survey data to determine the ability of models to predict presence versus absence. Models were also tested externally by assessing correlation with independent survey estimates of relative species abundance. AquaMaps outputs compare well to the existing methods tested, and inclusion of expert knowledge results in a general improvement in model outputs. The transparency, speed and adaptability of the AquaMaps system, as well as the existing online framework which allows expert review to compensate for sampling biases and thus improve model predictions are proposed as additional benefits for public and research use alike.","uuid":"2ad27883-c831-379f-a779-5fa959a01b00","authors":[{"forename":"Jonathan","surname":"Ready"},{"forename":"Kristin","surname":"Kaschner"},{"forename":"Andy B.","surname":"South"},{"forename":"Paul D.","surname":"Eastwood"},{"forename":"Tony","surname":"Rees"},{"forename":"Josephine","surname":"Rius"},{"forename":"Eli","surname":"Agbayani"},{"forename":"Sven O.","surname":"Kullander"},{"forename":"Rainer","surname":"Froese"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Ecological Modelling","firstAuthor":"Ready"},{"id":"6016476494","title":"Invasion pattern of Eupatorium adenophorum Spreng in southern China","type":"Journal Article","volume":"12","issue":"6","url":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/s10530-009-9584-3","tags":["2010","Aichi_B","China","CN","GB","GBIF_primary","GBIF_used","GBIF_VIP","invasive","Mexico_biodiversity","Target_9"],"keywords":["Biomedical and Life Sciences"],"pages":"1721-1730","year":"2010","publisher":"Springer Netherlands","abstract":"This study provides a detailed analysis of the invasion by Eupatorium adenophorum Spreng (Crofton weed) from Burma and Vietnam into Southern China since the 1940s.

Sixty-three years ago, Crofton weed appeared in Menghai county, Yunnan Province, from where it dispersed northwards and eastwards at an average speed of 20 km year\u22121. The invasion of E. adenophorum nonetheless showed pronounced variations in both time and space. Spread was relatively slow in the initial invasion period between 1940 and 1950, while the most rapid range expansions occurred in the 1980s. Environmental conditions at native and invaded sites were significantly different, reflecting a great adaptability of the species during colonization. These changes were greater than habitat differences between colonized and many adjacent un-colonized sites in Southern China. Therefore, immediate measures are required to stop a further northward and eastward expansion of Crofton weed.","uuid":"1315f37c-e8e1-3931-bef5-b2d9c025c06c","authors":[{"forename":"Weiguo","surname":"Sang"},{"forename":"Li","surname":"Zhu"},{"forename":"Jan","surname":"Axmacher"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Sang"},{"id":"6016478134","title":"Angiosperm wood structure: Global patterns in vessel anatomy and their relation to wood density and potential conductivity","type":"Journal Article","volume":"97","issue":"2","url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21622380","tags":["2010","AU","Australia","GB","GBIF_acknowledged","GBIF_used","species distribution","university","University of Cambridge","US"],"keywords":["angiosperms","evolutionary divergences","potential conductivity","variances","vessel lumen fraction","vessel number","vessel size","wood density","xylem sapwood"],"pages":"207-15","year":"2010","abstract":"Woody stems comprise a large biological carbon fraction and determine water transport between roots and leaves; their structure and function can influence both carbon and hydrological cycles. While angiosperm wood anatomy and density determine hydraulic conductivity and mechanical strength, little is known about interrelations across many species. We compiled a global data set comprising two anatomical traits for 3005 woody angiosperms: mean vessel lumen area (\u0100) and number per unit area (N). From these, we calculated vessel lumen fraction (F = \u0100N) and size to number ratio (S = \u0100\/N), a new vessel composition index. We examined the extent to which F and S influenced potential sapwood specific stem conductivity (K(S)) and wood density (D; dry mass\/fresh volume). F and S varied essentially independently across angiosperms. Variation in K(S) was driven primarily by S, and variation in D was virtually unrelated to F and S. Tissue density outside vessel lumens (D(N)) must predominantly influence D. High S should confer faster K(S) but incur greater freeze-thaw embolism risk. F should also affect K(S), and both F and D(N) should influence mechanical strength, capacitance, and construction costs. Improved theory and quantification are needed to better understand ecological costs and benefits of these three distinct dimensions.","uuid":"7233aac2-2360-30c8-8499-2bb0f27d687d","authors":[{"forename":"Amy E.","surname":"Zanne"},{"forename":"Mark","surname":"Westoby"},{"forename":"Daniel S.","surname":"Falster"},{"forename":"David D.","surname":"Ackerly"},{"forename":"Scott R.","surname":"Loarie"},{"forename":"Sarah E.
