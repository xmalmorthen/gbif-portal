However, the zoogeographical affinities of several taxa from South America and Antarctica have been subject to debate, bringing into question the extent of Antarctic isolation. Here we present new data on bryozoan species and their spatial distribution in the Argentine Patagonian (AP) region, as well as an analysis of the bryozoological similarities between deep ranges from Argentina and neighbouring regions. A total of 108 species of cheilostome bryozoans (378 samples), belonging to 59 genera was found. Five new genera and 36 new species were found in the AP region, while 71 species were reported for the first time from Argentina. The bathymetric ranges of 94 species (87 %) were expanded and a high proportion of the identified species (44.4 %) also had an Antarctic distribution. The bryozoological affinities found in the current study between the nearest geographical neighbours are in agreement with the hypothesis of the sequential separation of Gondwana during the Cenozoic. Moreover, a high number of shared species, mainly from the slope, were found in this study between the AP region and Antarctica, thus supporting the idea that the Southern Ocean may have been less isolated over geological time than once thought.","uuid":"55508308-1753-3858-b15a-ade027d5bad0","authors":[{"forename":"Blanca","surname":"Figuerola"},{"forename":"Dennis P.","surname":"Gordon"},{"forename":"Virginia","surname":"Polonio"},{"forename":"Javier","surname":"Cristobo"},{"forename":"Conxita","surname":"Avila"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Figuerola"},{"id":"6115952854","title":"Notes on the Chilean geographic distribution of several vascular plant species","type":"Journal Article","volume":"9","issue":"4","url":"http:\/\/www.checklist.org.br\/","tags":["2013","Aichi_E","Chile","Chile_biodiversity","CL","DE","GBIF_used","GBits_10","Germany","Target_19"],"keywords":[],"pages":"832-837","year":"2013","abstract":"New collections extend the Chilean geographic distributions of five native and one endemic vascular plant species: Coriaria ruscifolia L.

As such, it is important to monitor this species worldwide. However, outside the United States, it has been poorly studied. We studied this species at two scales: (i) at a local scale, evaluating the species presence and its determinants, along the ecotonal area between the steppe and the forest within north-western Patagonia, to reveal whether B. tectorum is actually invading natural ecosystems in areas comparable with those invaded in USA, and (ii) at a regional scale, through a search of literature and herbaria databases on B. tectorum in South America, to determine the current known distribution of the species in this subcontinent. Results indicate that it is already invading north-western Patagonia in Argentina, mainly in the semi-arid part of the region, and that precipitation influences the invasion process. We found that for South America, B. tectorum has been only documented in southern Argentina and Chile. Given the similarities to other invaded regions, the possibility of invasion for Patagonia has been predicted but not prevented. It is important to study changes in the invasion level where it is already established, and to encourage managers with prevention and control strategies. Combining this information with lessons from places with extensive periods of invasion could help to initiate management of the species in areas where the invasion process is beginning and before the species spreads widely.","uuid":"e59da200-04a0-356d-a0be-cd1cc2a77028","authors":[{"forename":"K.

The two lineages have diverged early in the evolution of the genus and up to today, there is very little geographical overlap between them. We worked with records of localities from the literature, herpetological collections and field data to evaluate habitat suitability of the genus Phymaturus. We used 11 environmental variables to develop environmental niche models (ENMs) for each group within the genus using the Maxent software, and to determine those variables that best explain the distribution of each group. We also estimated measures of niche similarity using ENMTools to determine whether niche differentiation is real or apparent. The geographical overlap between the groups was very low considering the large geographical range of the genus. Some variables, such as mean annual temperature, soil type and bare soil cover, have a high contribution to the models for both groups. The current niche overlap between Phymaturus groups indicates that the environmental niches of the palluma and patagonicus groups are not equivalent. Based on background analysis, we cannot reject the hypothesis that similarity (or divergence) between groups of Phymaturus is no more than expected based on the availability of habitat. The results of this study are a first approximation to the knowledge of the environmental variables associated with the palluma and patagonicus groups, and reveal that the ecological differences found between these groups are more likely due to habitat availability in their respective regions than to differences in habitat preferences.","uuid":"d01d094c-7d46-3654-8a5e-60523a0c51c5","authors":[{"forename":"Guillermo","surname":"Debandi"},{"forename":"Valeria","surname":"Corbal\u00e1n"},{"forename":"Jos\u00e9 A.","surname":"Scolaro"},{"forename":"Sergio Alberto","surname":"Roig-Ju\u00f1ent"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Austral Ecology","firstAuthor":"Debandi"},{"id":"6016478794","title":"Assembly of nonnative floras along elevational gradients explained by directional ecological filtering","type":"Journal Article","volume":"108","issue":"2","url":"http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/early\/2010\/12\/20\/1013136108.abstract","tags":["2011","2013_GBSS","AU","Australia","CH","Chile","Chile_biodiversity","CL","ecology","GBIF_reporting","GBIF_used","GBIF_VIP","Switzerland","university","US","USA_biodiversity","USDA"],"keywords":["altitudinal gradient","dispersal","invasivibility","nestedness","Rapoport effect"],"pages":"656-661","year":"2011","abstract":"Nonnative species richness typically declines along environmental gradients such as elevation. It is usually assumed that this is because few invaders possess the necessary adaptations to succeed under extreme environmental conditions. Here, we show that nonnative plants reaching high elevations around the world are not highly specialized stress tolerators but species with broad climatic tolerances capable of growing across a wide elevational range. These results contrast with patterns for native species, and they can be explained by the unidirectional expansion of nonnative species from anthropogenic sources at low elevations and the progressive dropping out of species with narrow elevational amplitudes\u2014a process that we call directional ecological filtering. Independent data confirm that climatic generalists have succeeded in colonizing the more extreme environments at higher elevations. These results suggest that invasion resistance is not conferred by extreme conditions at a particular site but determined by pathways of introduction of nonnative species. In the future, increased direct introduction of nonnative species with specialized ecophysiological adaptations to mountain environments could increase the risk of invasion. As well as providing a general explanation for gradients of nonnative species richness and the importance of traits such as phenotypic plasticity for many invasive species, the concept of directional ecological filtering is useful for understanding the initial assembly of some native floras at high elevations and latitudes.","uuid":"e053c295-f98c-3996-ae31-99964cb4f8b1","authors":[{"forename":"Jake M.","surname":"Alexander"},{"forename":"Christoph","surname":"Kueffer"},{"forename":"Curtis C.","surname":"Daehler"},{"forename":"Peter J.","surname":"Edwards"},{"forename":"An\u00edbal","surname":"Pauchard"},{"forename":"Tim","surname":"Seipel"},{"forename":"","surname":"MIREN Consortium"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","firstAuthor":"Alexander"}]
