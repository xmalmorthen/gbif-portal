This viral infection may have important implications for trichomonal virulence and disease pathogenesis. In this study we identified and genetic characterized three strains of TVVs isolated from T. vaginalis in Cuba. The three new predicted sequences of capsid protein and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase amounted to the previously determined 20 TVV sequences and other 21 viruses of Totiviridae family were used for a phylogenetic analysis. Four distinct monophyletic clades are shown in a phylogenetic tree. One corresponds with TVVs, other with Victorivirus, Leishmaniavirus and Eimeria brunetti virus and, other with viruses of the genus Totivirus and the last with Giardiavirus. The E. brunetti virus is identified in the phylogenetic tree as independent taxon between Leishmaniavirus and Victorivirus isolates, most closely related to Victorivirus. TVV constitute a monophyletic cluster distinguishable from all other viruses in Totiviridae family. This result suggested that TVV may be grouped in a separated genus and not inside of Giardiavirus. TVVs appear to be more closely related to protozoan viruses in the genus Leishmaniavirus and to fungal viruses in the genus Victorivirus than to other protozoan and fungal viruses in Giardiavirus and Totivirus. Among TVVs, four main groups can be recognized within Trichomonasvirus cluster, which correspond with the previous species classification proposed. Further studies, with more TVV strains, especially TVV3 and 4 strains, are needed in order to determine the phylogenetic relationship among Trichomonasvirus genus and specifically if TVV2 and 3 each also constitute a well-delimited group.","uuid":"030e3927-91e8-3661-9537-63f4d7b0f5a3","authors":[{"forename":"Jorge","surname":"Fraga"},{"forename":"Lazara","surname":"Rojas"},{"forename":"Idalia","surname":"Sariego"},{"forename":"Aym\u00e9","surname":"Fern\u00e1ndez-Calienes"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Infection, Genetics and Evolution","firstAuthor":"Fraga"},{"id":"6016481354","title":"Species typing of Cuban Trichomonas vaginalis virus by RT-PCR, and association of TVV-2 with high parasite adhesion levels and high pathogenicity in patients.","type":"Journal Article","volume":"157","issue":"9","url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22653538","tags":["2012","CU","Cuba","Cuba_biodiversity","GBIF_used","human health","taxonomy"],"keywords":["Adolescent","Cell Adhesion","Cuba","Genotype","Humans","Molecular Typing","Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction","Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction: m","Totiviridae","Totiviridae: classification","Totiviridae: genetics","Totiviridae: isolation & purification","Trichomonas Infections","Trichomonas Infections: parasitology","Trichomonas vaginalis","Trichomonas vaginalis: isolation & purification","Trichomonas vaginalis: pathogenicity","Trichomonas vaginalis: virology","Virulence"],"pages":"1789-95","year":"2012","abstract":"The viral infection of the parasite with T. vaginalis virus (TVV) may have important implications for trichomonal virulence.

Of the 37 clinical isolates studied, 21 were infected with TVV, 6 contained TVV-1, 12, TVV- 2 and 3 were co-infected with TVV-1 and -2. The strains infected with TVV showing highest adhesion level in comparison to not infected strains, with high statistical significance. The strains infected only with TVV-2 showing highest adhesion level in comparison to strains infected with TVV-1, with high statistical significance. The parasites classified as mild symptomatic are infected only with TVV-1, however the severe only with TVV-2. According to our results, it seems that only two TVV species are infecting the Cuban isolates. Further studies using higher number of strains should be conducted in order to corroborate these results.","uuid":"833cc95a-8e7e-3a48-9ce5-9efacb6e0d58","authors":[{"forename":"Jorge","surname":"Fraga"},{"forename":"Lazara","surname":"Rojas"},{"forename":"Idalia","surname":"Sariego"},{"forename":"Aym\u00e9","surname":"Fern\u00e1ndez-Calienes"},{"forename":"Fidel Angel","surname":"Nu\u00f1ez"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Fraga"},{"id":"6016484574","title":"Geographic distribution, colour variation and molecular diversity of miniature frogs of the Eleutherodactylus limbatus group from Cuba","type":"Journal Article","volume":"48","issue":"2","url":"http:\/\/www.mvences.de\/p\/p1\/Vences_A238.pdf","tags":["2012","Aichi_E","amphibians","CU","Cuba","Cuba_biodiversity","DE","GBIF_used","Germany","species distribution","Target_19","Taxonomy","university"],"keywords":["amphibia","anura","colour evolution","cytochrome b","e","E. iberia","E. jaumei","E. limbatus","E. orientalis","eleutherodactylidae","eleutherodactylus cubanus","geographic distribution","iberia","jaumei","limbatus","molecular phylogeny","orientalis","taxonomy","taxonomy.","terrarana"],"pages":"71-91","year":"2012","abstract":"The endemic Cuban Eleutherodactylus limbatus group contains five species of miniature species of frogs (E. cubanus, E. iberia, E. jaumei, E. limbatus, E. orientalis), and one larger and more generalized species (E. etheridgei). Several of the miniature species have contrasting colour patterns with bright yellow or white stripes on a dark dorsum, and two of these species are known to sequester skin alkaloids. Based on a review of literature, museum data and numerous own, unpublished field records we provide an updated list of georeferenced locality records of all species of the group that confirms their strict allopatric distribution pattern despite the close geographic proximity of some species. A phylogenetic tree based on newly analysed partial DNA sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (566 bp) placed the dull-coloured species E. etheridgei and E. cubanus in a basal position, followed by a well-differentiated E. orientalis, and a highly supported but poorly differentiated clade containing E. iberia, E. jaumei and E. limbatus. In addition to these three forms, this clade also included various subclades with a similar degree of differentiation, which rendered paraphyletic the formally described species, indicating the need for a taxonomic revision. The evolution of contrasting dorsal colour patterns (dorsolateral stripes on a dark brown, light brown or yellow dorsum) apparently was characterized by homoplasy. The highest diversity of this group is concentrated in small areas in the eastern mountains, and the population of E. limbatus sampled from western Cuba was genetically similar to an eastern Cuban population, suggesting that only one relatively shallow evolutionary lineage might have succeeded in expanding its range into the west of the island.","uuid":"3b5e39f4-970f-3312-82d2-77baf08a7c68","authors":[{"forename":"Ariel","surname":"Rodr\u00edguez"},{"forename":"Roberto","surname":"Alonso"},{"forename":"Jos\u00e9 Antonio","surname":"Rodr\u00edguez"},{"forename":"Miguel","surname":"Vences"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Salamandra","firstAuthor":"Rodr\u00edguez"}]
