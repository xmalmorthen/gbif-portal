Societies often seek to mitigate threats to these services through large-scale, costly restoration projects, such as the over one billion dollar Great Lakes Restoration Initiative currently underway. To help inform these efforts, we merged high-resolution spatial analyses of environmental stressors with mapping of ecosystem services for all five Great Lakes. Cumulative ecosystem stress is highest in near-shore habitats, but also extends offshore in Lakes Erie, Ontario, and Michigan. Variation in cumulative stress is driven largely by spatial concordance among multiple stressors, indicating the importance of considering all stressors when planning restoration activities. In addition, highly stressed areas reflect numerous different combinations of stressors rather than a single suite of problems, suggesting that a detailed understanding of the stressors needing alleviation could improve restoration planning. We also find that many important areas for fisheries and recreation are subject to high stress, indicating that ecosystem degradation could be threatening key services. Current restoration efforts have targeted high-stress sites almost exclusively, but generally without knowledge of the full range of stressors affecting these locations or differences among sites in service provisioning. Our results demonstrate that joint spatial analysis of stressors and ecosystem services can provide a critical foundation for maximizing social and ecological benefits from restoration investments.","uuid":"f79c8173-85f8-3c2c-a4e0-be51f6e37a65","authors":[{"forename":"J.

Geodia barretti, G. atlantica, G. macandrewii, and G. hentscheli are well established and widely distributed. The same goes for Geodia phlegraei, but this species shows a striking geographical and bathymetric variation, which led us to recognize two species, G. phlegraei and G. parva (here resurrected). Some Geodia are arctic species (G. hentscheli, G. parva), while others are typically boreal (G. atlantica, G. barretti, G. phlegraei, G. macandrewii).

Previous studies project expansion of species range for some species and local extinction elsewhere under climate change. Such range shifts raise concern for species whose long-term persistence is already threatened by other human disturbances such as fishing. However, few studies have attempted to assess the effects of future climate change on threatened vertebrate marine species using a multi-model approach. There has also been a recent surge of interest in climate change impacts on protected areas. This study applies three species distribution models and two sets of climate model projections to explore the potential impacts of climate change on marine species by 2050. A set of species in the North Sea, including seven threatened and ten major commercial species were used as a case study. Changes in habitat suitability in selected candidate protected areas around the UK under future climatic scenarios were assessed for these species. Moreover, change in the degree of overlap between commercial and threatened species ranges was calculated as a proxy of the potential threat posed by overfishing through bycatch. The ensemble projections suggest northward shifts in species at an average rate of 27 km per decade, resulting in small average changes in range overlap between threatened and commercially exploited species. Furthermore, the adverse consequences of climate change on the habitat suitability of protected areas were projected to be small. Although the models show large variation in the predicted consequences of climate change, the multi-model approach helps identify the potential risk of increased exposure to human stressors of critically endangered species such as common skate (Dipturus batis) and angelshark (Squatina squatina).","uuid":"a72cc70c-88ef-3fb4-92e6-436e22364879","authors":[{"forename":"Miranda C.","surname":"Jones"},{"forename":"Stephen R.","surname":"Dye"},{"forename":"Jose A.","surname":"Fernandes"},{"forename":"Thomas L.","surname":"Fr\u00f6licher"},{"forename":"John K.","surname":"Pinnegar"},{"forename":"Rachel","surname":"Warren"},{"forename":"William W.

MtDNA data showed evidence of eastern and western groups, with secondary admixture occurring in central Canada. This suggests that the boreal chickadee probably persisted in multiple glacial refugia, one in Beringia and at least one in the east. Palaeo-distribution modelling identified suitable habitat in Beringia (Alaska), Atlantic Canada and the southern United States, and correspond to divergence dates of 60-96 kya. Pairwise FST values for both mtDNA and microsatellites were significant for all comparisons involving Newfoundland, though mtDNA data suggest a more recent separation. Furthermore, unlike mtDNA data, nuclear data support population connectivity among the continental populations, possibly due to male-biased dispersal. Although both are significant, the isolation-by-distance signal is much stronger for mtDNA (r(2)=0.51) than for microsatellites (r(2)=0.05), supporting the hypothesis of male-biased dispersal. The population structure of the boreal chickadee was influenced by isolation in multiple refugia and contemporary barriers.

The most common methods for predicting the response of biodiversity to changing climate do not explicitly incorporate fundamental evolutionary and ecological processes that determine species' responses to changing climate such as reproduction, dispersal, and adaptation. We provide an overview of an emerging mechanistic spatial theory of species' range shifts under climate change. This theoretical framework explicitly defines the ecological processes that contribute to species range shifts via biologically meaningful dispersal, reproductive, and climate envelope parameters. We present methods for estimating the parameters of the model with widely available species occurrence and abundance data and apply these methods to empirical data for 12 North American butterfly species to illustrate the potential use of the theory for global change biology. The model predicts species persistence in light of current climate change and habitat loss. On average, we estimate the climate envelopes of our study species are shifting north at a rate of 3.25 km\/yr (\u00b1 1.36 km\/yr) and that our study species produce 3.46 viable offspring per individual per year (\u00b1 1.39). Based on our parameter estimates, we are able to predict the relative risk of our 12 study species lagging behind changing climate. This theoretical framework improves predictions of global change outcomes by facilitating the development and testing of hypotheses, providing mechanistic predictions of current and future range dynamics and encouraging the adaptive integration of theory and data. The theory is ripe for future developments such as the incorporation of biotic interactions and evolution of adaptations to novel climatic conditions and has the potential to be a catalyst for the development of more effective conservation strategies to mitigate losses of biodiversity from global climate change.

Kudzu is winter-deciduous in North America with stems re-growing each season. In Canada, growth occurs from May until September, long enough for production of viable seed. Although widely believed to be intolerant of winter temperatures typical in eastern Canada, underground structures may be able to withstand temperatures as low as \ue003308C, and northward range expansion is predicted by climate change models. Dispersal in North America is primarily through intentional planting by humans, with clonal propagation and limited seed production and germination contributing to local population expansion. Only one population is known in Canada, near Leamington, Ontario. Once established, kudzu is difficult to eliminate or control without repeated actions. Efforts to prevent the movement and sale of kudzu in Canada, along with early detection and rapid response, monitoring, and education, offer potential strategies for control.

(northern red oak), a tree species having moderate shade tolerance, is failing to regenerate across its native range in North America, largely due to its inability to compete with shade-tolerant species. Throughout central Europe, where it was introduced in the 18th and 19th centuries, Q. rubra exhibits prolific regeneration even when growing with shade-tolerant trees under closed canopy conditions. A better understanding of factors that allow the proliferation of Q. rubra in its adventive range may provide insights into the conditions necessary to promote Q. rubra in North America. Our study investigated the regeneration dynamics of Q. rubra in six hardwood stands near Freiburg, Germany in relation to site conditions and the relative abundance and growth of indigenous tree species in forest understoreys. Despite high (94\u201398%) canopy closure at all stands, the density of Q. rubra regeneration (<2 m in height) was greater than that of all other tree species combined, averaging 24 stems m\u22121. Density of Q. rubra seedlings reached 125 stems m\u22122 directly below seed trees; however, the lack of seedlings beyond 15 m from a seed tree suggested limited seed dispersal. Seedlings were less abundant at relatively fertile sites with lowest densities corresponding most closely to elevated soil calcium. The abundance of Q. rubra was most highly variable in the midstorey (trees and shrubs >2.0 m in height and <10 cm diameter at breast height) with densities ranging from 200 to 1500 stems ha\u22121. Periodic selective harvesting at all stands, appears to maintain a disturbed state of mid-succession that allows Q. rubra seedlings to persist and recruit into the midstorey as canopy gaps become available. Clearly, stands of this non-indigenous species are successfully regenerating and the dominance of Q. rubra appears to be sustainable. Despite its benign performance in North America, Q. rubra can be an effective competitor under suitable conditions. Our findings deemphasize the importance of canopy closure on Q. rubra regeneration and suggest that in North America, preliminary cuts performed prior to shelterwood harvests should focus on midstorey removal of competitor species especially following oak mast years.","uuid":"87112e69-bb3d-3657-b977-ab2ee3c4d796","authors":[{"forename":"Kelly C.","surname":"Major"},{"forename":"Peter","surname":"Nosko"},{"forename":"Christian","surname":"Kuehne"},{"forename":"Daniel","surname":"Campbell"},{"forename":"J\u00fcrgen","surname":"Bauhus"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Forest Ecology and Management","firstAuthor":"Major"},{"id":"6016483734","title":"Predicting shifts in parasite distribution with climate change: A multi-trophic level approach.","type":"Journal Article","url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23666800","tags":["2013","Aichi_E","CA","Canada","GBIF_used","GBIF_VIP","GBits_8","in_press","Maxent","North America_biodiversity","SDM","Target_19","US"],"keywords":["ecological mismatch","multi-trophic","odocoileus virginianus","parasitism","parelaphostrongylus","primary research article","species distribution modelling","tenuis","type of paper"],"year":"2013","abstract":"Climate change likely will lead to increasingly favourable environmental conditions for many parasites. However, predictions regarding parasitism's impacts often fail to account for the likely variability in host distribution and how this may alter parasite occurrence. Here, we investigate potential distributional shifts in the meningeal worm, Parelaphostrongylosis tenuis, a protostrongylid nematode commonly found in white-tailed deer in North America, whose lifecycle also involves a free-living stage and a gastropod intermediate host. We modelled the distribution of the hosts and free-living larva as a complete assemblage to assess whether a complex trophic system will lead to an overall increase in parasite distribution with climate change, or whether divergent environmental niches may promote an ecological mismatch. Using an ensemble approach to climate modelling under two different carbon emission scenarios, we show that while the overall trend is for an increase in niche breadth for each species, mismatches arise in habitat suitability of the free-living larva versus the definitive and intermediate hosts. By incorporating these projected mismatches into a combined model, we project a shift in parasite distribution accounting for all steps in the transmission cycle, and identify that overall habitat suitability of the parasite will decline in the Great Plains and southeastern USA, but will increase in the Boreal Forest ecoregion, particularly in Alberta. These results have important implications for wildlife conservation and management due to the known pathogenicity of parelaphostrongylosis to alternate hosts including moose, caribou and elk. Our results suggest that disease risk forecasts which fail to consider biotic interactions may be overly simplistic, and that accounting for each of the parasite's life stages is key to refining predicted responses to climate change.

To assist this process, we compare four methods for marine spatial planning of Madagascar's west coast.

The first method compares visual color classifications of primary variables, the second uses binary combinations of these variables to produce a categorical classification of management actions, the third is a target-based optimization using Marxan, and the fourth is conservation ranking with Zonation. We present results from each method, and compare the latter three approaches for spatial coverage, biodiversity representation, fishing cost and persistence probability. All results included large areas in the north, central, and southern parts of western Madagascar. Achieving 30% representation targets with Marxan required twice the fish catch loss than the categorical method. The categorical classification and Zonation do not consider targets for conservation features. However, when we reduced Marxan targets to 16.3%, matching the representation level of the \u201cstrict protection\u201d class of the categorical result, the methods show similar catch losses. The management category portfolio has complete coverage, and presents several management recommendations including strict protection. Zonation produces rapid conservation rankings across large, diverse datasets. Marxan is useful for identifying strict protected areas that meet representation targets, and minimize exposure probabilities for conservation features at low economic cost. We show that methods based on Zonation and a simple combination of variables can produce results comparable to Marxan for species representation and catch losses, demonstrating the value of comparing alternative approaches during initial stages of the planning process.

However, such a pattern has not yet been demonstrated at broad scales. We test if there is a gradient of increasing beta diversity with productivity. Location Canada. Methods Canada was clustered into regions of similar productivity regimes along three remotely sensed productivity axes (minimum and integrated annual productivity, seasonality of productivity) and elevation. The overall (\u03b2j), turnover (\u03b2sim) and nestedness (\u03b2nes) components of beta diversity within each productivity regime were estimated with pairwise dissimilarity metrics and related to cluster productivity with partial linear regression and with spatial autoregression. Tests were performed for all species, productivity breadth-based subsets (e.g. species occurring in many and a moderate number of productivity regimes), and pre- and post-1970 butterfly records. Beta diversity between adjacent clusters along the productivity gradients was also evaluated. Results Within-cluster \u03b2j and \u03b2sim increased with productivity and decreased with seasonality. The converse was true for \u03b2nes. All species subsets responded similarly; however, productivity\u2013beta-diversity relationships were weaker for the post-1970 temporal subset and strongest for species of moderate breadth. Between-cluster beta diversity (\u03b2j) and nestedness (\u03b2nes) declined with productivity. Main conclusions As predicted, beta diversity of communities within productivity regimes was observed to increase with productivity. This pattern was driven largely by a gradient of species turnover. Therefore, beta diversity may make an important contribution to the broad-scale gradient of species richness with productivity. However, this species richness gradient dominates regional beta diversity between productivity regimes, resulting in decreasing between-productivity dissimilarity with productivity driven by a concurrent decline in nestedness.","uuid":"c1b6c140-e66a-33f6-afa4-f98ed3eeb910","authors":[{"forename":"Margaret E.","surname":"Andrew"},{"forename":"Michael a.","surname":"Wulder"},{"forename":"Nicholas C.","surname":"Coops"},{"forename":"Guy","surname":"Baillargeon"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Global Ecology and Biogeography","firstAuthor":"Andrew"},{"id":"6016483234","title":"Pyganodon (Bivalvia: Unionoida: Unionidae) phylogenetics: a male- and female-transmitted mitochondrial DNA perspective","type":"Journal Article","volume":"63","issue":"2","url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22326838","tags":["2012","CA","Canada","GBIF_used","North America_biodiversity","species distribution","taxonomy","university","US"],"keywords":["Animals","Base Sequence","Cyclooxygenase 1","Cyclooxygenase 1: genetics","Cyclooxygenase 2","Cyclooxygenase 2: genetics","DNA","Female","Genes","Genetic Speciation","Genetic Variation","Male","Mitochondria","Mitochondria: genetics","Mitochondrial","Mitochondrial: genetics","Molecular Sequence Data","Phylogeny","Sequence Alignment","Sequence Analysis","Sex Determination Processes","Sex Determination Processes: genetics","Unionidae","Unionidae: classification","Unionidae: genetics"],"pages":"430-44","year":"2012","abstract":"Species boundaries, evolutionary relationships and geographic distributions of many unionoid bivalve species, like those in the genus Pyganodon, remain unresolved in Eastern North America. Because unionoid bivalves are one of the most imperiled groups of animals in the world, understanding the genetic variation within and among populations as well as among species is crucial for effective conservation planning. Conservation of unionoid species is indispensable from a freshwater habitat perspective but also because they possess a unique mitochondrial inheritance system where distinct gender-associated mitochondrial DNA lineages coexist: a female-transmitted (F) mt genome and a male-transmitted (M) mt genome that are involved in the maintenance of separate sexes (=dioecy). In this study, 42 populations of Pyganodon sp. were sampled across a large geographical range and fragments of two mitochondrial genes (cox1 and cox2) were sequenced from both the M- and F-transmitted mtDNA genomes. Our results support the recency of the divergence between P. cataracta and P. fragilis. We also found two relatively divergent F and M lineages within P. grandis. Surprisingly, the relationships among the P. grandis specimens in the F and M sequence trees are not congruent.

The following three predictions were tested and supported using the gynodioecious alpine cushion plant Silene acaulis (L.)

Female S. acaulis cushion plants produced significantly more flowers but they were smaller than those of hermaphrodites. Hermaphrodite cushions facilitated other plant species and pollinators more effectively than females, whilst females strongly facilitated more arthropods. Finally, female plants have significantly higher reproductive output as estimated by fruit and seed production, and this was directly related to visi- tation rate by pollinators.

The hypothesis that cushion or nurse plants in general are important to multiple trophic levels has been proposed but rarely tested. Alpine arthropod diversity is also largely understudied worldwide, and the plant-arthropod interactions reported are mostly negative, that is,. herbivory.

Arthropod richness, abundance, and diversity were all higher on cushion microsites relative to other vegetated sites. On a microclimatic scale, S. acaulis ameliorated stressful conditions for plants and invertebrates living inside it, but the highest levels of arthropod diversity were observed on cushions with tall plant growth. Hence, alpine cushion plants can be foundation species not only for other plant species but other trophic levels, and these impacts are expressed through both direct and indirect effects associated with altered environmental conditions and localized productivity.

A possibility for the lack of a relationship between PLD and range size may stem from the failure of past studies to account for the eff ect of species evolutionary ages, which may add to the dispersal capabilities of species. However, if dispersal over ecological (i.e. PLD) and across evolutionary (i.e. species evolutionary age) time scales continues to show no eff ect on range size then an outstanding question is why? Here we collected data on PLD, evolutionary ages and range sizes of seven tropical fish families (five families were reef-associated and two have dwell demersal habitats) to explore the independent and interactive effects of PLD and evolutionary age on range size. Separate analyses on each family showed that even after controlling for evolutionary age, PLD has an insignificant or a very small effect on range size. To shed light on why dispersal has such a limited effect on range size, we developed a global ocean circulation model to quantify the connectivity among tropical reefs relative to the potential dispersal conferred by PLD. We found that although there are several areas of great isolation in the tropical oceans, most reef habitats are within the reach of most species given their PLDs. These results suggest that the lack of habitat isolation can potentially render the constraining effect of dispersal on range size insignificant and explain why dispersal does not relate to range size in reef fishes.","uuid":"158bd6c8-475d-3459-bcb9-1a8b97b39603","authors":[{"forename":"Camilo","surname":"Mora"},{"forename":"Eric A.","surname":"Treml"},{"forename":"Jason","surname":"Roberts"},{"forename":"Kate","surname":"Crosby"},{"forename":"Denis","surname":"Roy"},{"forename":"Derek P.","surname":"Tittensor"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Ecography","firstAuthor":"Mora"},{"id":"6016481524","title":"Genetic Signals of Demographic Expansion in Downy Woodpecker (Picoides pubescens) after the Last North American Glacial Maximum.","type":"Journal Article","volume":"7","issue":"7","url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22792306","tags":["2012","Aichi_E","CA","Canada","GBIF_used","GBIF_VIP","niche_modeling","North America_biodiversity","SDM","species distribution","Target_19","university"],"keywords":[],"pages":"e40412","year":"2012","abstract":"The glacial cycles of the Pleistocene have been recognized as important, large-scale historical processes that strongly influenced the demographic patterns and genetic structure of many species.

Marine ectotherms more fully occupy the extent of latitudes tolerable within their thermal tolerance limits, and are consequently predicted to expand at their polewardrange boundaries and contract at their equatorward boundaries with climate warming.

Pairwise divergence times between all geographical units within each continent date well within the last 100 ka, and most likely, the last 50\u201310 ka. Main conclusions In contrast with its currently scattered distribution within each of Eurasia and North America, the mitogenetic structure of the P. phoebus complex in both continents is shallow and weak, and shows no evidence of geographical structure dating back earlier than the last glacial cycle. We argue that mtDNA data are consistent with recent range expansion across each of the two continents and with persistent glacial long-range gene flow which ceased during the Holocene. We propose that P. phoebus may represent a model for Holarctic alpine invertebrates with moderate dispersal abilities in that its genetic structure at a continental scale reflects extensive connectivity during the most recent glacial phases.","uuid":"7b50e402-91f5-3069-a0f8-bae8acd29881","authors":[{"forename":"Valentina","surname":"Todisco"},{"forename":"Paolo","surname":"Gratton"},{"forename":"Evgeny V.","surname":"Zakharov"},{"forename":"Christopher W.","surname":"Wheat"},{"forename":"Valerio","surname":"Sbordoni"},{"forename":"Felix A.H.","surname":"Sperling"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Todisco"},{"id":"6016484924","title":"Thermal Variability Increases the Impact of Autumnal Warming and Drives Metabolic Depression in an Overwintering Butterfly","type":"Journal Article","volume":"7","issue":"3","url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0034470","tags":["2012","CA","Canada","ecology","GBIF_used","Lepidoptera","university","US","USA_biodiversity"],"keywords":[],"pages":"e34470","year":"2012","abstract":"Increases in thermal variability elevate metabolic rate due to Jensen's inequality, and increased metabolic rate decreases the fitness of dormant ectotherms by increasing consumption of stored energy reserves. Theory predicts that ectotherms should respond to increased thermal variability by lowering the thermal sensitivity of metabolism, which will reduce the impact of the warm portion of thermal variability. We examined the thermal sensitivity of metabolic rate of overwintering Erynnis propertius (Lepidoptera: Hesperiidae) larvae from a stable or variable environment reared in the laboratory in a reciprocal common garden design, and used these data to model energy use during the winters of 1973\u20132010 using meteorological data to predict the energetic outcomes of metabolic compensation and phenological shifts. Larvae that experienced variable temperatures had decreased thermal sensitivity of metabolic rate, and were larger than those reared at stable temperatures, which could partially compensate for the increased energetic demands. Even with depressed thermal sensitivity, the variable environment was more energy-demanding than the stable, with the majority of this demand occurring in autumn. Autumn phenology changes thus had disproportionate influence on energy consumption in variable environments, and variable-reared larvae were most susceptible to overwinter energy drain. Therefore the energetic impacts of the timing of entry into winter dormancy will strongly influence ectotherm fitness in northern temperate environments. We conclude that thermal variability drives the expression of metabolic suppression in this species; that phenological shifts will have a greater impact on ectotherms in variable thermal environments; and that E. propertius will be more sensitive to shifts in phenology in autumn than in spring. This suggests that increases in overwinter thermal variability and\/or extended, warm autumns, will negatively impact all non-feeding dormant ectotherms which lack the ability to suppress their overwinter metabolic thermal sensitivity.","uuid":"7db1a150-9220-31cb-916d-c6edba5b67fe","authors":[{"forename":"Caroline M.","surname":"Williams"},{"forename":"Katie E.","surname":"Marshall"},{"forename":"Heath A.","surname":"MacMillan"},{"forename":"Jason D.

To be effective biodiversity surrogates, regionalizations should contain distinct species assemblages. This condition is not frequently evaluated and regionalizations are rarely assessed comparatively. We used a national dataset of Canadian butterfly collections to evaluate four regionalizations (ecoregions, land cover and productivity regime classifications, and a spatial grid) at two thematic resolutions using analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) and species indicator values. Overall, the spatially constrained schemes (ecoregions and grids) best captured patterns of butterfly community composition and species affinities, indicating that butterfly communities are strongly structured by space at the continent scale. In contrast, when comparing regions only within spatial or environmental neighbourhoods (i.e., comparing between regions that are adjacent along geographic or environmental gradients), all regionalizations performed similarly. Adjacency in environmental space is thus as important as physical adjacency at determining community dissimilarity. Productivity regimes and land cover will be useful biodiversity surrogates when considered in conjunction with space or within a spatially constrained area. This finding was confirmed with two ecoregional case studies (of the Algonquin-Lake Nipissing and Thompson\u2013Okanagan Plateau ecoregions), which also revealed that the relative performance of regionalizations depends upon the context of the study area. We conclude that including species data can improve the efficiency of environmental surrogates for systematic conservation planning.","uuid":"358c9432-ed2c-334c-9348-ddff54f2a3d5","authors":[{"forename":"Margaret E.","surname":"Andrew"},{"forename":"Michael A.","surname":"Wulder"},{"forename":"Nicholas C.","surname":"Coops"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Biological Conservation","firstAuthor":"Andrew"},{"id":"6016480334","title":"Predicting worldwide invasiveness for four major problematic decapods: an evaluation of using different calibration sets","type":"Journal Article","volume":"3","issue":"3","url":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/j.1600-0587.2010.06369.x\nhttp:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/j.1600-0587.2010.06369.x","tags":["2011","2013_GBSS","Aichi_B","CA","Canada","GBIF_used","invasive","Portugal","PT","Target_9","university"],"keywords":[],"pages":"448-459","year":"2011","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","abstract":"Recently, there has been much debate whether niche based models (NBM) can predict biological invasions into new areas.

Here we test the implications of using different calibration sets for building worldwide invasiveness models for four major problematic decapods: Cherax destructor, Eriocheir sinensis, Pacifastacus leniusculus and Procambarus clarkii. Using Artificial Neural Networks models we compared predictions containing either native range occurrences (NRO), native and invasive occurrences (NIO) and invasive only (IRO) coupled with three types of pseudo-absences \u2013 based on sampling only 1) the native range (NRA), 2) native and invasive ranges (NIA), and 3) worldwide random (WRA). We further analysed the potential gains in accuracy obtained through averaging across multiple models. Our results showed that NRO and IRO provided the best predictions for native and invaded ranges, respectively. Still, NIO provided the best balance in predicting both ranges. Pseudo-absences had a large influence on the predictive performance of the models, and were more important for predictiveness than types of occurrences. Specifically, WRA performed the best and NRA and NIA performed poorly. We also found little benefit in combining predictions since best performing single-models showed consistently higher accuracies. We conclude that NBM can provide useful information in forecasting invasiveness but are largely dependent on the type of initial information used and more efforts should be placed on recognizing its implications. Our results also show extensive areas which are highly suitable for the studied species worldwide. In total these areas reach from three to nine times the species current ranges and large portions of them are contiguous with currently invasive populations.","uuid":"41f8492b-cb60-3e2a-8d3d-adacfb7eca47","authors":[{"forename":"C\u00e9sar","surname":"Capinha"},{"forename":"Brian","surname":"Leung"},{"forename":"Pedro","surname":"Anast\u00e1cio"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Ecography","firstAuthor":"Capinha"},{"id":"6016479774","title":"An\u00e1lisis panbiogeogr\u00e1fico de Vexillata (Nematoda: Ornithostrongylidae) y sus hu\u00e9spedes (Mammalia: Rodentia)","type":"Journal Article","volume":"27","issue":"1","url":"http:\/\/www1.inecol.edu.mx\/azm\/AZM27(1)-2011\/27(1)03-Escalante.pdf","tags":["2011","CA","Canada","conservation","GBIF_acknowledged","GBIF_Sweden","GBIF_used","Mexico","MX","Spanish","university","VE","Venezuela"],"keywords":["biogeographical provinces","helminths parasites","mammals","nematodes","panbiogeography"],"pages":"25-46","year":"2011","abstract":"Panbiogeographic analysis of Vexillata (Nematoda: Ornithostrongylidae) and its hosts (Mammalia: Rodentia).

Designing conservation strategies for this group depends on basic knowledge of the geographic distribution and diversity of known species. So far, this information has been fragmented and incomplete. Here, we have synthesized the first global shark diversity pattern from a new database of published sources, including all 507 species described at present, and have identified hotspots of shark species richness, functional diversity and endemicity from these data. We have evaluated the congruence of these diversity measures and demonstrate their potential use in setting priority areas for shark conservation. Our results show that shark diversity across all species peaks on the continental shelves and at mid-latitudes (30-40 degrees N and S). Global hotspots of species richness, functional diversity and endemicity were found off Japan, Taiwan, the East and West coasts of Australia, Southeast Africa, Southeast Brazil and Southeast USA. Moreover, some areas with low to moderate species richness such as Southern Australia, Angola, North Chile and Western Continental Europe stood out as places of high functional diversity. Finally, species affected by shark finning showed different patterns of diversity, with peaks closer to the Equator and a more oceanic distribution overall. Our results show that the global pattern of shark diversity is uniquely different from land, and other well-studied marine taxa, and may provide guidance for spatial approaches to shark conservation. However, similar to terrestrial ecosystems, protected areas based on hotspots of diversity and endemism alone would provide insufficient means for safeguarding the diverse functional roles that sharks play in marine ecosystems.","uuid":"d10568a2-65b4-321a-8a46-22a25512bf3c","authors":[{"forename":"Luis O.","surname":"Lucifora"},{"forename":"Ver\u00f3nica B.","surname":"Garc\u00eda"},{"forename":"Boris","surname":"Worm"}],"editors":[{"forename":"Andrew","surname":"Hector"}],"publication_outlet":"PloS one","firstAuthor":"Lucifora"},{"id":"6016479684","title":"The Biology of Canadian Weeds. 149.

The New Zealand mud snail (Potamopyrgus antipodarum) was identified in the Great Lakes in 1991 and, more recently, identified on the west coast of Canada in 2006. This snail possesses many traits making it well suited for invasions including a high reproductive rate and a broad range of environmental tolerances. Its life-history characteristics enhance long-distance natural dispersal while further dispersal via a number of human-mediated vectors is probable. In some systems, this small snail reaches extremely high densities and can alter ecosystem services and trophic relationships by grazing primary producers, outcompeting native invertebrates, and negatively influencing higher trophic levels. Based on impacts of New Zealand mud snail elsewhere, and owing to their extensive invasion history in Europe and the western United States, there is considerable concern about the potential ecological impacts if New Zealand mud snail spreads in Canada, especially to inland freshwater or other coastal ecosystems. Fisheries and Oceans Canada conducted a national risk assessment, including a peer-review workshop during March 2010, to determine the potential risk posed by this non-indigenous gastropod to Canadian coastal and inland waters. This assessment evaluated the probability of arrival, survival, reproduction, and spread and associated potential consequences (impacts) to determine risk. These components were assessed using an expert survey and an expert workshop using the best available information on the biology, potential vectors of introduction, and impacts in both native and introduced ranges. This assessment also incorporated measures of environmental suitability from an ecological niche model and bedrock geology to identify locations with calcium deposits required for shell building. The risk assessment, based on a widespread invasion, concluded that the New Zealand mud snail generally posed low risks to most Canadian aquatic ecosystems with a moderate risk posed to freshwater biodiversity in most Canadian freshwater drainages. However, at smaller spatial scales the risk posed by this species could be much higher. Further, considerable uncertainty identified for some stages of the invasion cycle highlights the need for additional research, especially about potential impacts of this gastropod in Canadian ecosystems, as this information is critical for potential management.","institution":"Fisheries and Oceans Canada","uuid":"6bdf7f2e-15ab-3f52-aaa0-61ea0291415a","authors":[{"forename":"Thomas W.","surname":"Therriault"},{"forename":"Andrea M.","surname":"Weise"},{"forename":"Graham E.","surname":"Gillespie"},{"forename":"Todd J.","surname":"Morris"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Recherche","firstAuthor":"Therriault"},{"id":"6016478774","title":"First occurrence of the rare emballonurid bat Cyttarops alecto (Thomas, 1913) in Peru\u2014Only hard to find or truly rare?","type":"Journal Article","volume":"76","issue":"3","url":"http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/B7GX2-4YYGPS1-1\/2\/0c887a2ae5d1ac93f89bf727d5761578\nhttp:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S1616504710000558","tags":["2011","bats","CA","Canada","conservation","GBIF_used","museum","PE","Peru","university"],"keywords":["Cyttarops alecto","Distribution","Feeding habits","Panguana Biological Station","Reproduction"],"pages":"373-376","year":"2011","uuid":"e211f25c-ae0b-3c63-af1c-0d6651aaba5e","authors":[{"forename":"Sandra","surname":"Velazco"},{"forename":"V\u00edctor","surname":"Pacheco"},{"forename":"Angelika","surname":"Meschede"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Mammalian Biology - Zeitschrift f\u00fcr S\u00e4ugetierkunde","firstAuthor":"Velazco"},{"id":"6016480394","title":"Spatial and temporal trends in yellow stingray abundance: evidence from diver surveys","type":"Journal Article","volume":"90","issue":"3","url":"http:\/\/www.springerlink.com\/index\/10.1007\/s10641-010-9739-1","tags":["2011","CA","Canada","conservation","GBIF_used","IUCN Red List","marine","university","US"],"keywords":["citizen science","diver survey","elasmobranch","monitoring","population","trend","trophic interactions","yellow stingray"],"pages":"263-276","year":"2011","abstract":"Recent concerns about changing elasmobranch populations have prompted the need to understand their patterns of distribution and abundance through non-destructive sampling methods.

Here, we use 83,940 surveys collected by trained volunteer divers to examine spatial and temporal trends of the most frequently sighted elasmobranch species in the greater-Caribbean, the yellow stingray (Urobatis jamaicensis). Despite being relatively common and listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, little is known about the status of this species.

The strongest decline occurred in the Florida Keys, the most sampled region, where trends were similar among all areas, habitats and depths. In contrast, sighting frequency significantly increased in Jamaica where large fishes are severely depleted. We discuss possible explanations for these changes including habitat degradation, exploitation and changes in trophic interactions.

The morphological differences between the species are confirmed by nucleotide and amino acid substitutions within the cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) mtDNA gene. Phylogenetic analyses group T. leysae sp. nov. with T. californiana, T. actinia and T. minuta, which together form a sister group to a Mediterranean- North Atlantic species cluster. Morphological analyses of the skeleton included x-ray microtomography (\u00b5CT) and virtual 3D reconstruction, which was used for the first time in conjunction with the description of a new sponge species. Microtomography permitted the visualization and analysis of spicules within the skeletal context or isolated in silico. The method represents a valuable extension to the sponge taxonomist\u2019s toolbox since it allows morphometric measurements in 3D. \u00b5CT will thus supplement classical morphological methods such as light and scanning electron microscopy.","uuid":"45c75742-f8e6-3e11-8e3e-d679418bf56d","authors":[{"forename":"Isabel","surname":"Heim"},{"forename":"Michael","surname":"Nickel"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Heim"},{"id":"6016475234","title":"Biodiversity of the Deep-Sea Continental Margin Bordering the Gulf of Maine (NW Atlantic): Relationships among Sub-Regions and to Shelf Systems","type":"Journal Article","volume":"5","issue":"11","url":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0013832","tags":["2010","CA","Canada","conservation","GBIF_used","marine","species distribution","university","US"],"keywords":[],"pages":"e13832","year":"2010","publisher":"Public Library of Science","abstract":"Background: In contrast to the well-studied continental shelf region of the Gulf of Maine, fundamental questions regarding the diversity, distribution, and abundance of species living in deep-sea habitats along the adjacent continental margin remain unanswered. Lack of such knowledge precludes a greater understanding of the Gulf of Maine ecosystem and limits development of alternatives for conservation and management. Methodology\/Principal Findings: We use data from the published literature, unpublished studies, museum records and online sources, to: (1) assess the current state of knowledge of species diversity in the deep-sea habitats adjacent to the Gulf of Maine (39\u201343\u00b0N, 63\u201371\u00b0W, 150\u20133000 m depth); (2) compare patterns of taxonomic diversity and distribution of megafaunal and macrofaunal species among six distinct sub-regions and to the continental shelf; and (3) estimate the amount of unknown diversity in the region. Known diversity for the deep-sea region is 1,671 species; most are narrowly distributed and known to occur within only one sub-region. The number of species varies by sub-region and is directly related to sampling effort occurring within each. Fishes, corals, decapod crustaceans, molluscs, and echinoderms are relatively well known, while most other taxonomic groups are poorly known. Taxonomic diversity decreases with increasing distance from the continental shelf and with changes in benthic topography. Low similarity in faunal composition suggests the deep-sea region harbours faunal communities distinct from those of the continental shelf. Non-parametric estimators of species richness suggest a minimum of 50% of the deep-sea species inventory remains to be discovered.Conclusions\/Significance:The current state of knowledge of biodiversity in this deep-sea region is rudimentary. Our ability to answer questions is hampered by a lack of sufficient data for many taxonomic groups, which is constrained by sampling biases, life-history characteristics of target species, and the lack of trained taxonomists.","uuid":"a08acd88-e830-3b09-9540-5ac29621b24a","authors":[{"forename":"Noreen E.","surname":"Kelly"},{"forename":"Elizabeth K.","surname":"Shea"},{"forename":"Anna","surname":"Metaxas"},{"forename":"Richard L.","surname":"Haedrich"},{"forename":"Peter J.","surname":"Auster"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Kelly"},{"id":"6016476664","title":"Psilolechia clavulifera , a Lichen Species New to Canada","type":"Journal Article","volume":"124","issue":"2","tags":["2010","Aichi_B","CA","Canada","GBIF_used","invasive","Target_9"],"keywords":["lichen","new to Canada","Psilolechia clavulifera"],"pages":"181-182","year":"2010","abstract":"Psilolechia clavulifera is reported as new to Canada, where it was been found growing under a shaded rock overhang near Temagami, Ontario.

We developed a bioclimatic envelope model (BEM) for this species and examined the envelope's potential location in North America under various future climates. * 2We compared the future bioclimatic envelopes for L. huidobrensis using either simple scenarios comprising uniform changes in temperature\/precipitation or climate projections from general circulation models (GCMs). Our simple scenarios were: (i) an increase of 0.1\u00b0C per degree in latitude with a 20% increase in summer precipitation and a 20% decrease in winter precipitation and (ii) an overall increase of 3\u00b0C everywhere, also with the same changes in precipitation. For GCM-modelled climate change, we used the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis GCM (CGCM2) and the Hadley Centre climate model (HadCM3), each in combination with two scenarios from the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (A2 and B2). * 3The BEM results using the simple scenarios were more similar to each other than to the results obtained using GCM projections. The results were also qualitatively different (i.e. spatially different and divergent) depending on which GCM-scenario combination was used. * 4This modelling exercise illustrates that: (i) results using first approximation simple climate change scenarios can give predictions very different from those that use GCM-modelled climate projections (comprising a result that has worrying implications for empirical impact research) and that (ii) different GCM-models using the same scenario can give very different results (implying strong model dependency in projected biological impacts).","uuid":"0d773305-6fb9-398c-8ce6-f96dadb65184","authors":[{"forename":"Anna M.","surname":"Mika"},{"forename":"Jonathan A.","surname":"Newman"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Mika"}]
