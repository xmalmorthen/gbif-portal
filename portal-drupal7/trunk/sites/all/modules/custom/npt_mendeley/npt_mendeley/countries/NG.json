The hexane, ethylacetate and methanol extracts of Asystasia calyciana were evaluated invitro to determine inhibition of human pathogenic microorganisms made up of six bacteria and six fungi. The plant metabolites inhibited the growth of twelve test organisms at different concentrations between 12.5 and 200mg\/ml using agar diffusion plate method. The hexane extract exhibited higher antibacterial properties than both ethylacetate and methanol extracts of the plant. The hexane and ethylacetate extracts revealed higher antifungal properties than the methanol extract of A. calyciana, with activity of hexane and ethylacetate extracts comparable to that of the reference drug (tioconazole) against Candida albicans, Rhizopus stolon, Pneumonae notatum, Tricophyton rubrum and Epidermophyton floccosum and Candida albicans and Epidermophyton floccosum, respectively.","uuid":"0ab40ca6-244a-33c9-b231-bc21ffcb18a3","authors":[{"forename":"Abdulmumeen A.","surname":"Hamid"},{"forename":"Olapeju O.","surname":"Aiyelaagbe"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"International Journal of Chemical and Biochemical Sciences","firstAuthor":"Hamid"}]
