Methods: We used data for the hawkmoths (Lepidoptera, family Sphingidae) to assess three aspects of range information: (1) observed range filling in 100 km \u00d7 100 km grid cell squares, (2) observed European range extent and (3) observed climatic niche.

As with any biological data, range maps have some level of measurement error, but this error is rarely quantified. We assessed the error associated with amphibian range maps by comparing them with point locality data. Location Global. Methods The maps published by the Global Amphibian Assessment were assessed against two data sets of species point localities: the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), and a refined data set including recently published, high-quality presence data from both GBIF and other sources. Range fit was measured as the proportion of presence records falling within the range polygon(s) for each species. Results Using the high-quality point data provided better fit measures than using the raw GBIF data. Range fit was highly variable among continents, being highest for North American and European species (a fit of 84\u201394%), and lowest for Asian and South American species (a fit of 57\u201364%). At the global scale, 95% of amphibian point records were inside the ranges published in maps, or within 31 km of the range edge. However, differences among continents were striking, and more points were found far from range edges for South American and Asian species. Main conclusions The Global Amphibian Assessment range maps represent the known distribution of most amphibians well; this study provides measures of accuracy that can be useful for future research using amphibian maps as baseline data. Nevertheless, there is a need for greater investment in the continuous updating and improvement of maps, particularly in the megadiverse areas of tropical Asia and South America.","uuid":"33db80ec-d3b8-329b-9de9-dc26bf808e8d","authors":[{"forename":"Gentile Francesco","surname":"Ficetola"},{"forename":"Carlo","surname":"Rondinini"},{"forename":"Anna","surname":"Bonardi"},{"forename":"Vineet","surname":"Katariya"},{"forename":"Emilio","surname":"Padoa-schioppa"},{"forename":"Ariadne","surname":"Angulo"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Journal of Biogeography","firstAuthor":"Ficetola"},{"id":"6075545004","title":"Hymenoscyphus pseudoalbidu, the causal agent of European ash dieback","type":"Journal Article","url":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/mpp.12073","tags":["2013","Aichi_B","CH","GBIF_used","invasive","in_press","Switzerland","Target_9","taxonomy"],"keywords":["and the subsequent epidemic is spreading to the en","The ascomycete Hymenoscyphus pseudoalbidus (anamor"],"year":"2013","abstract":"The ascomycete Hymenoscyphus pseudoalbidus (anamorph Chalara fraxinea) causes a lethal disease known as ash dieback on Fraxinus excelsior and Fraxinus angustifolia in Europe.

Grasses (Poaceae) occupy among the warmest and coldest environments on earth but the role of cold tolerance evolution in generating this distribution is understudied. We studied cold tolerance of Danthonioideae (c. 280 species), a major constituent of the austral temperate grass flora. We determined differences in cold tolerance among species from different continents grown in a common winter garden and assessed the relationship between measured cold tolerance and that predicted by species ranges. We then used temperatures in current ranges and a phylogeny of 81% of the species to study the timing and mode of cold tolerance evolution across the subfamily. Species ranges generally underestimate cold tolerance but are still a meaningful representation of differences in cold tolerance among species. We infer cold tolerance evolution to have commenced at the onset of danthonioid diversification, subsequently increasing in both pace and extent in certain lineages. Interspecific variation in cold tolerance is better accounted for by spatial than phylogenetic distance. Contrary to expectations, temperature - low temperature in particular - appears not to limit the distribution of this temperate clade. Competition, time or dispersal limitation could explain its relative absence from northern temperate regions.","uuid":"46595bcb-2500-3089-9ec2-774533cafcd7","authors":[{"forename":"Aelys M","surname":"Humphreys"},{"forename":"H Peter","surname":"Linder"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"The New phytologist","firstAuthor":"Humphreys"},{"id":"6016484674","title":"Control of Conyza spp. with Glyphosate \u2013 A Review of the Situation in Europe","type":"Journal Article","volume":"49","issue":"1","url":"http:\/\/www.agriculturejournals.cz\/web\/PPS.htm","tags":["2013","agriculture","CH","ES","FR","France","GB","GBIF_used","plants","Spain","Switzerland"],"keywords":["Conyza bonariensis (L.)

Although the role of species diversity in the maintenance of ecosystem processes has been widely investigated, the role of rare species remains controversial. A critical issue is whether common species insure against the loss of functions supported by rare species. This issue is even more critical in species-rich ecosystems where high functional redundancy among species is likely and where it is thus often assumed that ecosystem functioning is buffered against species loss. Here, using extensive datasets of species occurrences and functional traits from three highly diverse ecosystems (846 coral reef fishes, 2,979 alpine plants, and 662 tropical trees), we demonstrate that the most distinct combinations of traits are supported predominantly by rare species both in terms of local abundance and regional occupancy. Moreover, species that have low functional redundancy and are likely to support the most vulnerable functions, with no other species carrying similar combinations of traits, are rarer than expected by chance in all three ecosystems. For instance, 63% and 98% of fish species that are likely to support highly vulnerable functions in coral reef ecosystems are locally and regionally rare, respectively. For alpine plants, 32% and 89% of such species are locally and regionally rare, respectively. Remarkably, 47% of fish species and 55% of tropical tree species that are likely to support highly vulnerable functions have only one individual per sample on average. Our results emphasize the importance of rare species conservation, even in highly diverse ecosystems, which are thought to exhibit high functional redundancy. Rare species offer more than aesthetic, cultural, or taxonomic diversity value; they disproportionately increase the potential breadth of functions provided by ecosystems across spatial scales. As such, they are likely to insure against future uncertainty arising from climate change and the ever-increasing anthropogenic pressures on ecosystems. Our results call for a more detailed understanding of the role of rarity and functional vulnerability in ecosystem functioning.","uuid":"16e05535-cd17-3ef8-9e1b-9b4b89669e51","authors":[{"forename":"David","surname":"Mouillot"},{"forename":"David R.","surname":"Bellwood"},{"forename":"Christopher","surname":"Baraloto"},{"forename":"Jerome","surname":"Chave"},{"forename":"Rene","surname":"Galzin"},{"forename":"Mireille","surname":"Harmelin-Vivien"},{"forename":"Michel","surname":"Kulbicki"},{"forename":"Sebastien","surname":"Lavergne"},{"forename":"Sandra","surname":"Lavorel"},{"forename":"Nicolas","surname":"Mouquet"},{"forename":"C.

Today, a small subset of the boreal woody flora found during certain Plio-Pleistocene warm periods inhabits Greenland. Whether the twenty-first century warming will induce a re-colonization of a rich woody flora depends on the roles of climate and migration limitations in shaping species ranges. Using potential treeline and climatic niche modelling, we project shifts in areas climatically suitable for tree growth and 56 Greenlandic, North American and European tree and shrub species from the Last Glacial Maximum through the present and into the future. In combination with observed tree plantings, our modelling highlights that a majority of the non-native species find climatically suitable conditions in certain parts of Greenland today, even in areas harbouring no native trees. Analyses of analogous climates indicate that these conditions are widespread outside Greenland, thus increasing the likelihood of woody invasions. Nonetheless, we find a substantial migration lag for Greenland's current and future woody flora. In conclusion, the projected climatic scope for future expansions is strongly limited by dispersal, soil development and other disequilibrium dynamics, with plantings and unintentional seed dispersal by humans having potentially large impacts on spread rates.","uuid":"dcd700fa-fd9a-36b0-b856-78208ba8c30f","authors":[{"forename":"Signe","surname":"Normand"},{"forename":"Christophe","surname":"Randin"},{"forename":"Ralf","surname":"Ohlem\u00fcller"},{"forename":"Christian","surname":"Bay"},{"forename":"Toke T","surname":"H\u00f8ye"},{"forename":"Erik D","surname":"Kj\u00e6r"},{"forename":"Christian","surname":"K\u00f6rner"},{"forename":"Heike","surname":"Lischke"},{"forename":"Luigi","surname":"Maiorano"},{"forename":"Jens","surname":"Paulsen"},{"forename":"Peter B","surname":"Pearman"},{"forename":"Achilleas","surname":"Psomas"},{"forename":"Urs a","surname":"Treier"},{"forename":"Niklaus E.","surname":"Zimmermann"},{"forename":"Jens-Christian","surname":"Svenning"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

Methods We mapped the range of the subfamily Danthonioideae, and used 39,000 locality records and an ensemble modelling approach to define areas with suitable danthonioid habitat. We used a well-sampled, dated phylogeny to estimate the number and direction of historical dispersal events, based on parsimony optimization. We tested for the impact of wind direction on dispersal rate using a likelihood approach, and for the effects of barrier width with a regression approach. Results We found 17 geographically isolated areas with suitable habitats for danthonioids. All currently suitable Southern Hemisphere areas have been occupied, but three apparently suitable areas in the Northern Hemisphere have not. We infer that southern Africa was first occupied in the Oligocene and that dispersal to the other areas was initiated in the middle Miocene. Inferred dispersal rate was correlated with the width of the disjunctions, up to a distance of 5000 km. There was no support for wind direction having influenced differences in dispersal rate. Main conclusions The current range of the Danthonioideae can be predicted ecologically (areas with suitable habitat) and historically (the width of the disjunctions separating the areas with suitable habitat and the area of origin). The direction of dispersal is dictated by the area of origin and by serendipity: there is no evidence for general patterns of dispersal, for example for dispersal occurring more frequently over land than over sea or in an easterly versus a westerly direction around the Southern Hemisphere. Thus the range and range-filling of Danthonioideae can be accounted for by surprisingly few variables: habitat suitability, distance between suitable areas, and area of origin.","uuid":"718a4137-923d-39a1-a042-918d3fec3d05","authors":[{"forename":"H.","surname":"Peter Linder"},{"forename":"Alexandre","surname":"Antonelli"},{"forename":"Aelys M.","surname":"Humphreys"},{"forename":"Michael D.","surname":"Pirie"},{"forename":"Rafael O.","surname":"W\u00fcest"}],"editors":[{"forename":"Richard","surname":"Ladle"}],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Peter Linder"},{"id":"6016483874","title":"Do the elevational limits of deciduous tree species match their thermal latitudinal limits?","type":"Journal Article","volume":"online","url":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/geb.12040","tags":["2013","Aichi_E","CH","Europe_biodiversity","GBIF_used","in_press","plants","Switzerland","Switzerland_biodiversity","Target_19"],"keywords":["christophe randin","climate equilibrium","correspondence","deciduous trees","elevation","europe","latitude","leading edge","plant","post-glacial history","swiss alps"],"year":"2013","uuid":"cac41473-86ac-3088-bc6e-c7a524dec1a0","authors":[{"forename":"Christophe F.","surname":"Randin"},{"forename":"Jens","surname":"Paulsen"},{"forename":"Yann","surname":"Vitasse"},{"forename":"Chris","surname":"Kollas"},{"forename":"Thomas","surname":"Wohlgemuth"},{"forename":"Niklaus E.","surname":"Zimmermann"},{"forename":"Christian","surname":"K\u00f6rner"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Randin"},{"id":"6016481784","title":"Divergent and narrower climatic niches characterize polyploid species of European primroses in Primula sect.

Results The four species differed significantly from each other in mono-dimensional comparisons of climatological variables and occupied distinct habitats in the multi-dimensional environmental space.

Furthermore, our results revealed narrower niche breadths and geographical ranges in species of P. sect. Aleuritia at higher ploidy levels.

Species numbers are presented for all neotropical countries and rust-plant- ratios calculated. It is discussed whether the ratio for a given region can be explained by the species richness of vascular plants alone or whether it is caused by additional factors. In the first case, ratios should apply globally and vary only slightly; in the second case, more diverging ratios are expected. Observed ratios ranged between 1:16 and 1:124 in the neotropics. The large differences are certainly influenced by unequal levels of investiga- tion, rendering interpretation difficult. Differences seem also to be influenced by the tax- onomic composition of floras regarding the percentage of host families or genera bearing different numbers of rust species. This indicates that rust species richness is not driven solely by plant species richness. Ratios calculated for Switzerland, Austria and Japan are distinctly higher than for the neotropics indicating that certain temperate regions are proportionally richer in rust fungi than the neotropics. Uredinial states and short-cycled rust species prevail in the neotropics. The preponderance of uredinial states may be due to the heterogeneous spatial composition of certain vegetation types in the wet tropics.

The purpose of this document is to demonstrate how comprehensive problem formulation can be used to develop a conceptual model and to identify potential exposure pathways, using Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) maize as a case study. Within problem formulation, the insecticidal trait, the crop, the receiving environment, and protection goals were characterized, and a conceptual model was developed to identify routes through which aquatic organisms may be exposed to insecticidal proteins in maize tissue. Following a tiered approach for exposure assessment, worst-case exposures were estimated using standardized models, and factors mitigating exposure were described. Based on exposure estimates, shredders were identified as the functional group most likely to be exposed to insecticidal proteins. However, even using worst-case assumptions, the exposure of shredders to Bt maize was low and studies supporting the current risk assessments were deemed adequate. Determining if early tier toxicity studies are necessary to inform the risk assessment for a specific GM crop should be done on a case by case basis, and should be guided by thorough problem formulation and exposure assessment. The processes used to develop the Bt maize case study are intended to serve as a model for performing risk assessments on future traits and crops.","uuid":"e35486bb-9372-3f20-8e6f-cc24005e31e4","authors":[{"forename":"Keri","surname":"Carstens"},{"forename":"Jennifer","surname":"Anderson"},{"forename":"Pamela","surname":"Bachman"},{"forename":"Adinda","surname":"De Schrijver"},{"forename":"Galen","surname":"Dively"},{"forename":"Brian","surname":"Federici"},{"forename":"Mick","surname":"Hamer"},{"forename":"Marco","surname":"Gielkens"},{"forename":"Peter","surname":"Jensen"},{"forename":"William","surname":"Lamp"},{"forename":"Stefan","surname":"Rauschen"},{"forename":"Geoff","surname":"Ridley"},{"forename":"J\u00f6rg","surname":"Romeis"},{"forename":"Annabel","surname":"Waggoner"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Transgenic Research","firstAuthor":"Carstens"},{"id":"6016482874","title":"Predicting present and future intra-specific genetic structure through niche hindcasting across 24 millennia.","type":"Journal Article","volume":"15","issue":"7","url":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/j.1461-0248.2012.01779.x\nhttp:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22515791","tags":["2012","alpine_biodiversity","CH","climate","Europe_biodiversity","GBIF_used","paleobiogeography","Switzerland","university"],"notes":"anahi.espindola@gmail.com<m:linebreak><\/m:linebreak>\n        <m:linebreak><\/m:linebreak>GBIF used: see appendix","keywords":["Alleles","Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism Analysis","Climate","Climate Change","Europe","Gene Flow","Phylogeography","Population Dynamics","Ranunculaceae","Ranunculaceae: genetics"],"pages":"649-57","year":"2012","abstract":"Paleoclimatic reconstructions coupled with species distribution models and identification of extant spatial genetic structure have the potential to provide insights into the demographic events that shape the distribution of intra-specific genetic variation across time.

Our interdisciplinary approach, applicable to virtually any taxon, is an advance in inferring how climate change impacts species' genetic structures.","uuid":"d7582cd1-3449-368a-8f1f-d3a7d1392d22","authors":[{"forename":"Anah\u00ed","surname":"Esp\u00edndola"},{"forename":"Lo\u00efc","surname":"Pellissier"},{"forename":"Luigi","surname":"Maiorano"},{"forename":"Wim","surname":"Hordijk"},{"forename":"Antoine","surname":"Guisan"},{"forename":"Nadir","surname":"Alvarez"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Ecology letters","firstAuthor":"Esp\u00edndola"},{"id":"6016484124","title":"Invasive species distribution models - how violating the equilibrium assumption can create new insights","type":"Journal Article","issue":"11","url":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/j.1466-8238.2012.00768.x","tags":["2012","Aichi_B","alpine_biodiversity","CH","FR","France","France_biodiversity","GBIF_used","GBIF_VIP","Global_biodiversity","invasive","Switzerland","Target_9","university"],"notes":"\n        <m:bold>From Duplicate 1 ( <\/m:bold>\n        <m:bold><\/m:bold>\n        <m:bold>\n          <m:italic>Invasive species distribution models - how violating the equilibrium assumption can create new insights<\/m:italic>\n        <\/m:bold>\n        <m:bold><\/m:bold>\n        <m:bold> - Gallien, Laure; Douzet, Rolland; Pratte, Steve; Zimmermann, Niklaus E.; Thuiller, Wilfried )<m:linebreak><\/m:linebreak>\n        <\/m:bold>\n        <m:linebreak><\/m:linebreak>*Correspondence: Laure Gallien, Laboratoire d\u2019Ecologie Alpine, CNRS UMR 5553, Universit\u00e9 Joseph Fourier, BP 53, 38041 Grenoble Cedex 9, France.

Invasives are not in equilibrium with their envi- ronment and niche quantification and transferability in space and time are limited. Here, we test whether combining global- and regional-scale data in a novel frame- work can overcome these limitations. Beyond simply improving regional niche modelling of non-native species, the framework also makes use of the violation of regional equilibrium assumptions, and aims at estimating the stage of invasion, range filling and risk of spread in the near future for 27 invasive species in the French Alps. Innovation For each invader we built three sets of SDMs using a committee averaging method: one global model and two regional models (a conventional model and one using the global model output to weight pseudo-absences).Model performances were compared using the area under the receiver operating charac- teristic curve, the true skill statistic, sensitivity and specificity scores. Then, we extracted the predictions for observed presences and compared them to global and regional models. This comparison made it possible to identify whether invasive species were observed within or outside of their regional and global niches. Main conclusions This study provides a novel methodological framework for improving the regional modelling of invasive species, where the use of a global model output to weight pseudo-absences in a regional model significantly improved the predictive performance of regional SDMs.Additionally, the compari- son of the global and regional model outputs revealed distinct patterns of niche estimates and range filling among the species. These differences allowed us to draw conclusions about the stage of invasion and the risk of spread in the near future, which both correspond to experts\u2019 expectations. This framework can be easily applied to a large number of species and is therefore useful for control of biological invasions and eradication planning.","uuid":"79571b42-e4ad-3654-ac43-4ee33fcfec0f","authors":[{"forename":"Laure","surname":"Gallien"},{"forename":"Rolland","surname":"Douzet"},{"forename":"Steve","surname":"Pratte"},{"forename":"Niklaus E.","surname":"Zimmermann"},{"forename":"Wilfried","surname":"Thuiller"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Gallien"},{"id":"6016483204","title":"Hydroclimatic and hydrochemical controls on Plecoptera diversity and distribution in northern freshwater ecosystems","type":"Journal Article","volume":"693","issue":"1","url":"http:\/\/www.springerlink.com\/index\/10.1007\/s10750-012-1085-1","tags":["2012","Aichi_E","CA","Canada","CH","climate","freshwater","GB","GBIF_used","GB_biodiversity","SE","Sweden","Switzerland","Target_19","university","US","USGS"],"keywords":["Alpha diversity","Catchment inter-comparison","Climate change","Hydroclimatic","Northern temperate regions","Plecoptera","Streamflow"],"pages":"39-53","year":"2012","abstract":"Freshwater ecosystems in the mid- to upper-latitudes of the northern hemisphere are particularly vulnerable to the impact of climate change as slight changes in air temperature can alter the form, timing, and magnitude of precipitation and consequent influence of snowmelt on streamflow dynamics.

It is so far not known whether different box-tree subspecies (or varieties) are similarly affected by this invasive moth.

The preference for \u2018Rotundifolia\u2019, the variety with the largest leaves in the tests, remained when intervariety differences in foliar area (mean leaf size \u00d7 number of leaves) were taken into account.

The core of this type of research is a database with field observations. Here we use the Himalayan Uplands Plant Database (HUP), which consists of extensive collections of botanic survey information collected by the senior author in the Himalayas and in renowned public herbaria over more than 25 years. The HUP database is primarily based on preserved herbarium specimens and presently holds more than 164,000 occurrence records of vascular plants. It contains the records of more than 2,000 collectors and observers who had either directly or indirectly contributed, or records that were derived from herbarium label information. Consistent taxonomic information and the sound use of taxonomy is the key to success of any exercise with large amounts of heterogeneous biological collection data. Taxonomy, especially on the scales of developing consistent cross-border registries, still comprises one of the most obvious bottlenecks to our understanding of biodiversity. In the absence of consistent backbone taxonomies, physical documentation (collecting, preserving, and curating of good and representative herbarium specimens or other vouchers), and quality control must be stressed as necessary preconditions to vegetation and ecology-related studies. Although inherent synonymy rates are obviously quite variable among different taxonomic groups, there is no logical, automated, or permanent procedure that could identify or constrain synonyms. A wide range of Floras, monographs, taxonomic treatments, original publications, and databases has been consulted in HUP to identify and verify specimens, and to develop, at least internally, consistent taxonomies. Other challenges of using such a large collection are the long time span covered and the diversity and inconsistency of spatial and altitudinal information. Thus, large parts of the data are currently not covered by current georeferencing databases such as BioGeomancer or by international taxonomic databases such as ITIS (Integrated Taxonomic Information System). The history of modern biodiversity exploration is brief\u2014in the Himalayas, a mere 200 years\u2014whereas dramatic ecological change and disturbance including deforestation, land degradation, melting glaciers, and increasing severity of natural hazards occurred during the periods of collection. Historic data are thus precious not only on account of the \u201cpriority principle\u201d in biological taxonomy. To ensure the highest level of usage of such precious data, we regard the availability of the data for similar and potentially even larger exercises as critically important. Here we show that a new culture needs to develop and mature for sharing, exploiting, and improving primary biodiversity data and for taxonomic work in progress. The example of HUP is used to give a step-by-step best practice guidance to make biological data digitally available online using existing and rapidly developing data-sharing infrastructures. The information of the database columns was transferred into the Darwin Core 2 format and uploaded to the publicly accessible Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF; www.gbif.org). Through GBIF it is also available using the Mountain Biodiversity Portal (MBP; www.mountain biodiversity.org), which allows to query, filter, and download GBIF data specific for mountain areas, with a horizontal (region) and vertical (elevation, climate) dimension and includes many options. In addition, a first-version XML-metadata information was created and uploaded to the National Biological Information Infrastructure (NBII) metadata clearinghouse (National Biological Information Infrastructure 2010; http:\/\/metadata.nbii.gov\/clearinghouse). Thus, the HUP data are made accessible worldwide either by searching for metadata in the NBII clearinghouse database and through the authors, by searching for original biological data at GBIF, or by searching for mountain-specific information at the Global Mountain Biodiversity Assessment (GMBA) mountain biodiversity portal.","chapter":"Chapter 6","city":"Tokyo","uuid":"e6491155-f252-31a1-bbb4-51442fe9a883","authors":[{"forename":"Dirk","surname":"Nemitz"},{"forename":"Falk","surname":"Huettmann"},{"forename":"Eva M.","surname":"Spehn"},{"forename":"Wolf Bernhard","surname":"Dickor\u00e9"}],"editors":[{"forename":"Falk","surname":"Huettmann"}],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Nemitz"},{"id":"6016483524","title":"First record of the onion psyllid Bactericera tremblayi (Wagner, 1961) in France (Insecta: Hemiptera: Sternorrhyncha: Psylloidea), new symptoms on leek crops and reassessment of the B. nigricornis -group distribution","type":"Journal Article","volume":"42","issue":"3","url":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/epp.12005","tags":["2012","Aichi_B","CH","France_biodiversity","GB","GBIF_used","GBits_32","Global_biodiversity","invasive","Switzerland","Target_9"],"keywords":[],"pages":"585-590","year":"2012","abstract":"The triozid Bactericera tremblayi, or onion psyllid, is recorded for the first time from France, and is associated for the first time with important damage on leek crops in several regions of the country.

Here we performed phylogenetic analyses using DNA sequences from three plastid loci to reconstruct the evolutionary history of Gesnerioideae and to investigate its relationship with other lineages of Gesneriaceae and Lamiales. Our molecular data confirm the inclusion of the South Pacific Coronanthereae and the Old World (OW) monotypic genus Titanotrichum in Gesnerioideae and the sister-group relationship of this subfamily to the rest of the OW Gesneriaceae. Calceolariaceae and the NW genera Peltanthera and Sanango appeared successively sister to Gesneriaceae, whereas Cubitanthus, which has been previously assigned to Gesneriaceae, is shown to be related to Linderniaceae. Based on molecular dating and biogeographical reconstruction analyses, we suggest that ancestors of Gesneriaceae originated in South America during the Late Cretaceous. Distribution of Gesneriaceae in the Palaeotropics and Australasia was inferred as resulting from two independent long-distance dispersals during the Eocene and Oligocene, respectively. In a short time span starting at 34 Mya, ancestors of Gesnerioideae colonized several Neotropical regions including the tropical Andes, Brazilian Atlantic forest, cerrado, Central America and the West Indies. Subsequent diversification within these areas occurred largely in situ and was particularly extensive in the mountainous systems of the Andes, Central America and the Brazilian Atlantic forest. Only two radiations account for 90% of the diversity of Gesneriaceae in the Brazilian Atlantic forest, whereas half of the species richness in the northern Andes and Central America originated during the last 10 Myr from a single radiation. \u00a9","uuid":"defe30d7-62c3-3a35-b1e5-928d4d5c0292","authors":[{"forename":"Mathieu","surname":"Perret"},{"forename":"Alain","surname":"Chautems"},{"forename":"Andr\u00e9a Onofre","surname":"De Araujo"},{"forename":"Nicolas","surname":"Salamin"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society","firstAuthor":"Perret"},{"id":"6016481834","title":"Effects of re-oligotrophication and climate warming on plankton richness and community stability in a deep mesotrophic lake","type":"Journal Article","volume":"121","issue":"8","url":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/j.1600-0706.2011.20055.x","tags":["2012","Aichi_B","CH","climate","GBIF_used","Netherlands","NL","Switzerland","Switzerland_biodiversity","Target_10"],"keywords":[],"pages":"1317-1327","year":"2012","abstract":"We studied the effects of re-oligotrophication and climate warming on plankton richness and community stability over a period of 30 years in the deep mesotrophic Lake Zurich (Switzerland).

We used multiple linear regression to test: 1) the effect of environmental variability over time and depth on the accrual of plankton richness; and 2) the relative effect of richness and environmental variability on the stability of plankton. Environmental change was characterised by increase in temperature, decrease in phosphorus levels, reduced temporal variability of both, and higher heterogeneity of phosphorus over depth (spatial heterogeneity). These conditions occurred concurrently with accrual in plankton taxonomic and functional richness. Increase in temperature and spatial heterogeneity were the best predictors of phytoplankton richness, while phytoplankton richness and spatial heterogeneity had the strongest effects on zooplankton richness. Temporal stability in phytoplankton biovolume was mainly affected by variability in phosphorus and temperature, while zooplankton abundance levels were more strongly linked to fluctuations in nitrogen, temperature and phytoplankton biovolumes. Our analysis highlights that climate warming and re-oligotrophication may favour an increase in spatial (depth) heterogeneity in the water column of deep lakes, enhancing the potential for phytoplankton species co-existence and an increase in plankton richness. Our analysis also suggests that the intensity of fluctuations in key environmental variables can be a better predictor of plankton community stability then average richness.","uuid":"14aa90bd-1315-3bd7-b090-d330dec98300","authors":[{"forename":"Francesco","surname":"Pomati"},{"forename":"Blake","surname":"Matthews"},{"forename":"Jukka","surname":"Jokela"},{"forename":"Andrea","surname":"Schildknecht"},{"forename":"Bas W.","surname":"Ibelings"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Pomati"},{"id":"6016483794","title":"Spatial distribution and ecological variation of re-discovered German truffle habitats","type":"Journal Article","volume":"online","url":"http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1754504812000268","tags":["2012","CH","DE","ecology","GBIF_used","Germany","Germany_biodiversity","in_press","IUCN Red List","Switzerland","university"],"keywords":["Climate change","Cultivation potential","Host vegetation","Site characteristics","Spatial distribution","Truffle habitat","Tuber aestivum"],"year":"2012","abstract":"Several truffle species (Tuber spp.) are highly prized by chefs and gourmets with some commanding prices of up to \u20ac9.000 kg\u22121 on international markets.

In the future, increased direct introduction of nonnative species with specialized ecophysiological adaptations to mountain environments could increase the risk of invasion. As well as providing a general explanation for gradients of nonnative species richness and the importance of traits such as phenotypic plasticity for many invasive species, the concept of directional ecological filtering is useful for understanding the initial assembly of some native floras at high elevations and latitudes.","uuid":"e053c295-f98c-3996-ae31-99964cb4f8b1","authors":[{"forename":"Jake M.","surname":"Alexander"},{"forename":"Christoph","surname":"Kueffer"},{"forename":"Curtis C.","surname":"Daehler"},{"forename":"Peter J.","surname":"Edwards"},{"forename":"An\u00edbal","surname":"Pauchard"},{"forename":"Tim","surname":"Seipel"},{"forename":"","surname":"MIREN Consortium"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","firstAuthor":"Alexander"},{"id":"6016478934","title":"Projecting the potential invasion of the Pink Spotted Hawkmoth (Agrius cingulata) across Africa","type":"Journal Article","volume":"57","issue":"2","url":"http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/09670874.2010.546439","tags":["2011","Aichi_B","CH","GB","GBIF_used","invasive","niche_modeling","SDM","Switzerland","Target_9","university"],"keywords":["BIOMOD","climate niche","ecological niche model","Ipomoea","Maxent","species distribution","Sphingidae","sweet potato"],"pages":"153-159","year":"2011","abstract":"Agrius cingulata (Lepidoptera, Sphingidae) is widespread in the Americas, but has recently begun to spread into Africa.

To assess what taxa constitute the main reservoirs of monkeypox, we tested whether human cases were associated with (i) rope squirrels (Funisciurus sp.), which were implicated in monkeypox outbreaks elsewhere in the DRC in the 1980s, or (ii) terrestrial rodents in the genera Cricetomys and Graphiurus, which are believed to be monkeypox reservoirs in West Africa. Results suggest that the best predictors of human monkeypox cases are proximity to dense forests and associated habitat preferred by rope squirrels. The risk of contracting monkeypox is significantly greater near sites predicted to be habitable for squirrels (OR = 1.32; 95% CI 1.08-1.63). We recommend that semi-deciduous rainforests with oil-palm, the rope squirrel's main food source, be prioritized for monitoring.","uuid":"fcc251bf-cabb-3892-bb9b-b50ffdec229c","authors":[{"forename":"Trevon","surname":"Fuller"},{"forename":"Henri A.","surname":"Thomassen"},{"forename":"Prime M.","surname":"Mulembakani"},{"forename":"Sara C.","surname":"Johnston"},{"forename":"James O.","surname":"Lloyd-Smith"},{"forename":"Neville K.","surname":"Kisalu"},{"forename":"Timothee K.","surname":"Lutete"},{"forename":"Seth","surname":"Blumberg"},{"forename":"Joseph N.","surname":"Fair"},{"forename":"Nathan D.","surname":"Wolfe"},{"forename":"Robert L.","surname":"Shongo"},{"forename":"Pierre","surname":"Formenty"},{"forename":"Hermann","surname":"Meyer"},{"forename":"Linda L.","surname":"Wright"},{"forename":"Jean-Jacques","surname":"Muyembe"},{"forename":"Wolfgang","surname":"Buermann"},{"forename":"Sassan","surname":"Saatchi"},{"forename":"Emile","surname":"Okitolonda"},{"forename":"Lisa","surname":"Hensley"},{"forename":"Thomas B.","surname":"Smith"},{"forename":"Anne W.","surname":"Rimoin"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"EcoHealth","firstAuthor":"Fuller"},{"id":"6016479064","title":"Prospects for biological control of Ambrosia artemisiifolia in Europe: learning from the past","type":"Journal Article","volume":"51","issue":"6","url":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/j.1365-3180.2011.00879.x","tags":["2011","Aichi_B","CABI","CH","GB","GBIF_used","invasive","Switzerland","Target_9","university"],"keywords":["biological control","common ragweed","fungi","herbivory","integrated weed management","non-native\/exotic weed"],"pages":"559-573","year":"2011","abstract":"The recent invasion by Ambrosia artemisiifolia (common ragweed) has, like no other plant, raised the awareness of invasive plants in Europe. The main concerns regarding this plant are that it produces a large amount of highly allergenic pollen that causes high rates of sensitisation among humans, but also A. artemisiifolia is increasingly becoming a major weed in agriculture. Recently, chemical and mechanical control methods have been developed and partially implemented in Europe, but sustainable control strategies to mitigate its spread into areas not yet invaded and to reduce its abundance in badly infested areas are lacking. One management tool, not yet implemented in Europe but successfully applied in Australia, is biological control. Almost all natural enemies that have colonised A. artemisiifolia in Europe are polyphagous and cause little damage, rendering them unsuitable for a system management approach. Two fungal pathogens have been reported to adversely impact A. artemisiifolia in the introduced range, but their biology makes them unsuitable for mass production and application as a mycoherbicide. In the native range of A. artemisiifolia, on the other hand, a number of herbivores and pathogens associated with this plant have a very narrow host range and reduce pollen and seed production, the stage most sensitive for long-term population management of this winter annual. We discuss and propose a prioritisation of these biological control candidates for a classical or inundative biological control approach against A. artemisiifolia in Europe, capitalising on past experiences from North America, Asia and Australia.","uuid":"7491693f-dddd-37ad-bf7d-44ce04272f50","authors":[{"forename":"E.","surname":"Gerber"},{"forename":"U.","surname":"Schaffner"},{"forename":"A.","surname":"Gassmann"},{"forename":"H.

In Mexico, the northernmost part of its distribution range, its conservation status, is particularly critical, while its potential and actual distribution is poorly known. We propose an ensemble model (EM) of the potential distribution for the jaguar in Mexico and identify the priority areas for conservation. Location Mexico. Methods We generated our EM based on three presence-only methods (Ecological Niche Factor Analysis, Mahalanobis distance, Maxent) and considering environmental, biological and anthropogenic factors. We used this model to evaluate the efficacy of the existing Mexican protected areas (PAs), to evaluate the adequacy of the jaguar conservation units (JCUs) and to propose new areas that should be considered for conservation and management of the species in Mexico. Results Our results outline that 16% of Mexico (c. 312,000 km2) can be considered as suitable for the presence of the jaguar. Furthermore, 13% of the suitable areas are included in existing PAs and 14% are included in JCUs (Sanderson et al., 2002). Main conclusions Clearly much more should be carried out to establish a proactive conservation strategy. Based on our results, we propose here new jaguar conservation and management areas that are important for a nationwide conservation blueprint.","uuid":"85e3601c-8d08-3bd0-9915-9d1215f800db","authors":[{"forename":"Clarita","surname":"Rodr\u00edguez-Soto"},{"forename":"Octavio","surname":"Monroy-Vilchis"},{"forename":"Luigi","surname":"Maiorano"},{"forename":"Luigi","surname":"Boitani"},{"forename":"Juan Carlos","surname":"Faller"},{"forename":"Miguel \u00c1.","surname":"Briones"},{"forename":"Rodrigo","surname":"N\u00fa\u00f1ez"},{"forename":"Octavio","surname":"Rosas-Rosas"},{"forename":"Gerardo","surname":"Ceballos"},{"forename":"Alessandra","surname":"Falcucci"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Diversity and Distributions","firstAuthor":"Rodr\u00edguez-Soto"},{"id":"6016479724","title":"Global habitat suitability models of terrestrial mammals","type":"Journal Article","volume":"366","issue":"1578","url":"http:\/\/www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov\/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3140734&tool=pmcentrez&rendertype=abstract","tags":["2011","AE","AR","Argentina","AU","Australia","CH","conservation","Conservation International","GB","GBIF_used","GBIF_VIP","IT","Italy","IUCN Red List","mammals","Switzerland","UNEP","United Arab Emirates","university","US"],"keywords":["Animals","Biological","Conservation of Natural Resources","Conservation of Natural Resources: methods","Ecosystem","Mammals","Mammals: growth & development","Maps as Topic","Models"],"pages":"2633-41","year":"2011","abstract":"Detailed large-scale information on mammal distribution has often been lacking, hindering conservation efforts. We used the information from the 2009 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species as a baseline for developing habitat suitability models for 5027 out of 5330 known terrestrial mammal species, based on their habitat relationships. We focused on the following environmental variables: land cover, elevation and hydrological features. Models were developed at 300 m resolution and limited to within species' known geographical ranges. A subset of the models was validated using points of known species occurrence. We conducted a global, fine-scale analysis of patterns of species richness. The richness of mammal species estimated by the overlap of their suitable habitat is on average one-third less than that estimated by the overlap of their geographical ranges. The highest absolute difference is found in tropical and subtropical regions in South America, Africa and Southeast Asia that are not covered by dense forest. The proportion of suitable habitat within mammal geographical ranges correlates with the IUCN Red List category to which they have been assigned, decreasing monotonically from Least Concern to Endangered. These results demonstrate the importance of fine-resolution distribution data for the development of global conservation strategies for mammals.","uuid":"6938c8d2-0a14-318b-8d84-9faa454131ea","authors":[{"forename":"Carlo","surname":"Rondinini"},{"forename":"Moreno","surname":"Di Marco"},{"forename":"Federica","surname":"Chiozza"},{"forename":"Giulia","surname":"Santulli"},{"forename":"Daniele","surname":"Baisero"},{"forename":"Piero","surname":"Visconti"},{"forename":"Michael","surname":"Hoffmann"},{"forename":"Jan","surname":"Schipper"},{"forename":"Simon N.","surname":"Stuart"},{"forename":"Marcelo F.","surname":"Tognelli"},{"forename":"Giovanni","surname":"Amori"},{"forename":"Alessandra","surname":"Falcucci"},{"forename":"Luigi","surname":"Maiorano"},{"forename":"Luigi","surname":"Boitani"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

Postglacial warming caused severe range shifts of such taxa into higher latitudes and altitudes. We selected the boreomontane butterfly Lycaena helle (Denis & Schifferm\u00fcller, 1775) as an example to demonstrate the genetic effects of range changes, and to document the recent status of highly fragmented remnant populations. We analysed five polymorphic microsatellite loci in 1059 individuals sampled at 50 different localities scattered over the European distribution area of the species. Genetic differentiation was strong among the mountain ranges of western Europe, but we did not detect similarly distinct genetic groups following a geographical pattern in the more eastern areas. The Fennoscandian populations form a separate genetic group, and provide evidence for a colonization from southern Finland via northern Scandinavia to south-central Sweden. Species distribution modelling suggests a large extension of the spatial distribution during the last glacial maximum, but highlights strong retractions to a few mountain areas under current conditions. These findings, combined with our genetic data, suggest a more or less continuous distribution of L. helle throughout central Europe at the end of the last ice age. As a consequence of postglacial warming, the species retreated northwards to Fennoscandia and escaped increasing temperatures through altitudinal shifts. Therefore, the species is today restricted to population remnants located at the mountain tops of western Europe, genetically isolated from each other, and evolved into genetically unique entities.
