As such, it is important to monitor this species worldwide. However, outside the United States, it has been poorly studied. We studied this species at two scales: (i) at a local scale, evaluating the species presence and its determinants, along the ecotonal area between the steppe and the forest within north-western Patagonia, to reveal whether B. tectorum is actually invading natural ecosystems in areas comparable with those invaded in USA, and (ii) at a regional scale, through a search of literature and herbaria databases on B. tectorum in South America, to determine the current known distribution of the species in this subcontinent. Results indicate that it is already invading north-western Patagonia in Argentina, mainly in the semi-arid part of the region, and that precipitation influences the invasion process. We found that for South America, B. tectorum has been only documented in southern Argentina and Chile. Given the similarities to other invaded regions, the possibility of invasion for Patagonia has been predicted but not prevented. It is important to study changes in the invasion level where it is already established, and to encourage managers with prevention and control strategies. Combining this information with lessons from places with extensive periods of invasion could help to initiate management of the species in areas where the invasion process is beginning and before the species spreads widely.","uuid":"e59da200-04a0-356d-a0be-cd1cc2a77028","authors":[{"forename":"K.

The two lineages have diverged early in the evolution of the genus and up to today, there is very little geographical overlap between them. We worked with records of localities from the literature, herpetological collections and field data to evaluate habitat suitability of the genus Phymaturus. We used 11 environmental variables to develop environmental niche models (ENMs) for each group within the genus using the Maxent software, and to determine those variables that best explain the distribution of each group. We also estimated measures of niche similarity using ENMTools to determine whether niche differentiation is real or apparent. The geographical overlap between the groups was very low considering the large geographical range of the genus. Some variables, such as mean annual temperature, soil type and bare soil cover, have a high contribution to the models for both groups. The current niche overlap between Phymaturus groups indicates that the environmental niches of the palluma and patagonicus groups are not equivalent. Based on background analysis, we cannot reject the hypothesis that similarity (or divergence) between groups of Phymaturus is no more than expected based on the availability of habitat. The results of this study are a first approximation to the knowledge of the environmental variables associated with the palluma and patagonicus groups, and reveal that the ecological differences found between these groups are more likely due to habitat availability in their respective regions than to differences in habitat preferences.","uuid":"d01d094c-7d46-3654-8a5e-60523a0c51c5","authors":[{"forename":"Guillermo","surname":"Debandi"},{"forename":"Valeria","surname":"Corbal\u00e1n"},{"forename":"Jos\u00e9 A.","surname":"Scolaro"},{"forename":"Sergio Alberto","surname":"Roig-Ju\u00f1ent"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Austral Ecology","firstAuthor":"Debandi"},{"id":"6016482954","title":"Situaci\u00f3n Del Zorro Vinagre (Speothos Venaticus) En El Extremo Sur De Su Distribuci\u00f3n (Argentina)","type":"Journal Article","volume":"37","issue":"1","url":"http:\/\/xa.yimg.com\/kq\/groups\/28662970\/1468922882\/name\/GilyLobo2012.pdf\nhttp:\/\/www.interciencia.org\/","tags":["2012","AR","Argentina","Argentina_biodiversity","conservation","ES","GBIF_used","Spain","Spanish","species distribution"],"keywords":[],"pages":"21-28","year":"2012","abstract":"The fox vinegar (Speothos venaticus Lund, 1842) is a kind little known, threatened and difficult to detect. in the southern end of its range, Argentina, inhabiting an environment also highly threatened Atlantic forest interior. between methods available to predict the distribution geographical species, generalized linear models (GLM) provides results tailored to the actual distribution, although it requires reliable information on the locations where the species is absent.

We obtained locality data for all Patagonian species from different sources and used them, together with environmental variables, to model their potential distribution. We then used a reserve-selection algorithm to assess the performance of the existing protected area network in representing all lizard species, and to identify new priority areas. Our results indicate that the existing protected areas fail to protect 10 of the 60 species modeled. To protect at least 5% of the geographic distribution of all species, the existing reserve network would need an additional 3.7% of the study area, whereas to protect at least 10% of the distribution of species, an extra 9.9% would be needed. We found eleven main priority areas needed to protect at least 5% or 10% of the distribution of all species of lizards. In conclusion, the current reserve network is not very effective at protecting the lizards of Patagonia, particularly those species with range-restricted distributions.

To study the residence status of the populations and movement patterns of these species we com- bine geographic information about the occurrence of the species with local information about abundance and mark-recapture studies in the central Monte desert. Analysis at biogeographic scale showed that both species mainly occur in arid and semi-arid environments of Argentina.

Banding of birds also showed that these species are highly mobile, at least in this region.

Designing conservation strategies for this group depends on basic knowledge of the geographic distribution and diversity of known species. So far, this information has been fragmented and incomplete. Here, we have synthesized the first global shark diversity pattern from a new database of published sources, including all 507 species described at present, and have identified hotspots of shark species richness, functional diversity and endemicity from these data. We have evaluated the congruence of these diversity measures and demonstrate their potential use in setting priority areas for shark conservation. Our results show that shark diversity across all species peaks on the continental shelves and at mid-latitudes (30-40 degrees N and S). Global hotspots of species richness, functional diversity and endemicity were found off Japan, Taiwan, the East and West coasts of Australia, Southeast Africa, Southeast Brazil and Southeast USA. Moreover, some areas with low to moderate species richness such as Southern Australia, Angola, North Chile and Western Continental Europe stood out as places of high functional diversity. Finally, species affected by shark finning showed different patterns of diversity, with peaks closer to the Equator and a more oceanic distribution overall. Our results show that the global pattern of shark diversity is uniquely different from land, and other well-studied marine taxa, and may provide guidance for spatial approaches to shark conservation. However, similar to terrestrial ecosystems, protected areas based on hotspots of diversity and endemism alone would provide insufficient means for safeguarding the diverse functional roles that sharks play in marine ecosystems.","uuid":"d10568a2-65b4-321a-8a46-22a25512bf3c","authors":[{"forename":"Luis O.","surname":"Lucifora"},{"forename":"Ver\u00f3nica B.","surname":"Garc\u00eda"},{"forename":"Boris","surname":"Worm"}],"editors":[{"forename":"Andrew","surname":"Hector"}],"publication_outlet":"PloS one","firstAuthor":"Lucifora"},{"id":"6016479624","title":"The Initiation of a Biological Control Programme Against Pompom Weed, Campuloclinium macrocephalum (Less.)

In the 1980s, C. macrocephalum started slowly extending its range and in the 1990s and 2000s it entered a dramatic expansion phase. It invades grasslands, savannas and wetlands where it has a significant impact on biological diversity. Control of C. macrocephalum has, so far, been based on herbicides, as mechanical approaches were found to exacerbate infestations through disturbance. However, due to the extent of the invasion, the financial and environmental costs of treating all C. macrocephalum infestations with herbicides would be prohibitive. As a result, a biological control programme was initiated against the weed in 2003. Surveys conductedonC. macrocephalum in its native range, indicated that northernArgentina has the highest diversity of natural enemies associated with the plant. Three insect species, Zeale (=Adesmus) nigromaculatus Klug (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), Liothrips tractabilis Mound & Pereyra (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) and Cochylis campuloclinium Brown (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), and one pathogen, Puccinia eupatorii Dietel (Pucciniales: Pucciniaceae) were rated (based on damage, range and abundance) as having the most potential as biological control agents for C. macrocephalum. This paper is a review of the biology, host range and potential impacts of these agents, as well as the prospects for the control of C. macrocephalum in South Africa.","uuid":"e382a29d-8757-390c-ace1-e239726dc05f","authors":[{"forename":"A.J.","surname":"McConnachie"},{"forename":"E.","surname":"Retief"},{"forename":"L.","surname":"Henderson"},{"forename":"F.","surname":"McKay"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"African Entomology","firstAuthor":"McConnachie"},{"id":"6016480194","title":"Marine biodiversity in the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of South America: knowledge and gaps.","type":"Journal Article","volume":"6","issue":"1","url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0014631","tags":["2011","AR","Argentina","BR","Brazil","Chile","CL","CO","Colombia","conservation","GBIF_used","marine","museum","research institute","species verification","Uruguay","UY","VE","Venezuela","WCS"],"keywords":["Ecology\/Community Ecology and Biodiversity","Marine and Aquatic Sciences\/Biological Oceanograph","Marine and Aquatic Sciences\/Conservation Science","Review"],"pages":"e14631","year":"2011","publisher":"Public Library of Science","uuid":"6f68da27-be7f-3f96-9421-29b7be8edcea","authors":[{"forename":"Patricia","surname":"Miloslavich"},{"forename":"Eduardo","surname":"Klein"},{"forename":"Juan M.","surname":"D\u00edaz"},{"forename":"Cristi\u00e1n E.","surname":"Hern\u00e1ndez"},{"forename":"Gregorio","surname":"Bigatti"},{"forename":"Lucia","surname":"Campos"},{"forename":"Felipe","surname":"Artigas"},{"forename":"Julio","surname":"Castillo"},{"forename":"Pablo E.","surname":"Penchaszadeh"},{"forename":"Paula E.","surname":"Neill"},{"forename":"Alvar","surname":"Carranza"},{"forename":"Mar\u00eda V.","surname":"Retana"},{"forename":"Juan M.","surname":"D\u00edaz de Astarloa"},{"forename":"Mirtha","surname":"Lewis"},{"forename":"Pablo","surname":"Yorio"},{"forename":"Mar\u00eda L.","surname":"Piriz"},{"forename":"Diego","surname":"Rodr\u00edguez"},{"forename":"Yocie","surname":"Yoneshigue-Valentin"},{"forename":"Luiz","surname":"Gamboa"},{"forename":"Alberto","surname":"Mart\u00edn"}],"editors":[{"forename":"Simon","surname":"Thrush"}],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Miloslavich"},{"id":"6016479344","title":"Climate Change and American Bullfrog Invasion: What Could We Expect in South America?","type":"Journal Article","volume":"6","issue":"10","url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0025718","tags":["2011","Aichi_B","amphibians","AR","Argentina","BR","Brazil","climate","CO","Colombia","conservation","GBIF_used","invasive","IUCN Red List","niche_modeling","research institute","SDM","Target_9","university"],"keywords":[],"pages":"e25718","year":"2011","abstract":"Background: Biological invasion and climate change pose challenges to biodiversity conservation in the 21st century. Invasive species modify ecosystem structure and functioning and climatic changes are likely to produce invasive species' range shifts pushing some populations into protected areas. The American Bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus) is one of the hundred worst invasive species in the world. Native from the southeast of USA, it has colonized more than 75% of South America where it has been reported as a highly effective predator, competitor and vector of amphibian diseases. Methodology\/Principal Findings: We modeled the potential distribution of the bullfrog in its native range based on different climate models and green-house gases emission scenarios, and projected the results onto South America for the years of 2050 and 2080. We also overlaid projected models onto the South American network of protected areas. Our results indicate a slight decrease in potential suitable area for bullfrog invasion, although protected areas will become more climatically suitable. Therefore, invasion of these sites is forecasted. Conclusion\/Significance: We provide new evidence supporting the vulnerability of the Atlantic Forest Biodiversity Hotspot to bullfrog invasion and call attention to optimal future climatic conditions of the Andean-Patagonian forest, eastern Paraguay, and northwestern Bolivia, where invasive populations have not been found yet. We recommend several management and policy strategies to control bullfrog invasion and argue that these would be possible if based on appropriate articulation among government agencies, NGOs, research institutions and civil society.","uuid":"50cab368-70a6-3666-95ae-b27c84651ba5","authors":[{"forename":"Javier","surname":"Nori"},{"forename":"J.

Our projections showed good agreement with known feral populations of American bullfrog in Argentina. By implementing the \u2018\u2018Multivariate Environmental Similarity Surface\u2019\u2019 analysis, we be able to determine that factors such as low precipitations or highest altitudes could be limiting the species\u2019 ability to invade the west and south of the country.

We used the information from the 2009 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species as a baseline for developing habitat suitability models for 5027 out of 5330 known terrestrial mammal species, based on their habitat relationships. We focused on the following environmental variables: land cover, elevation and hydrological features. Models were developed at 300 m resolution and limited to within species' known geographical ranges. A subset of the models was validated using points of known species occurrence. We conducted a global, fine-scale analysis of patterns of species richness. The richness of mammal species estimated by the overlap of their suitable habitat is on average one-third less than that estimated by the overlap of their geographical ranges. The highest absolute difference is found in tropical and subtropical regions in South America, Africa and Southeast Asia that are not covered by dense forest. The proportion of suitable habitat within mammal geographical ranges correlates with the IUCN Red List category to which they have been assigned, decreasing monotonically from Least Concern to Endangered. These results demonstrate the importance of fine-resolution distribution data for the development of global conservation strategies for mammals.","uuid":"6938c8d2-0a14-318b-8d84-9faa454131ea","authors":[{"forename":"Carlo","surname":"Rondinini"},{"forename":"Moreno","surname":"Di Marco"},{"forename":"Federica","surname":"Chiozza"},{"forename":"Giulia","surname":"Santulli"},{"forename":"Daniele","surname":"Baisero"},{"forename":"Piero","surname":"Visconti"},{"forename":"Michael","surname":"Hoffmann"},{"forename":"Jan","surname":"Schipper"},{"forename":"Simon N.","surname":"Stuart"},{"forename":"Marcelo F.","surname":"Tognelli"},{"forename":"Giovanni","surname":"Amori"},{"forename":"Alessandra","surname":"Falcucci"},{"forename":"Luigi","surname":"Maiorano"},{"forename":"Luigi","surname":"Boitani"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

Within South America diversity is not distributed evenly at both local and continental scales and this has led to the recognition of various areas with unique species assemblages. Several schemes currently exist which divide the continental-level diversity into large species assemblages referred to as biomes. Here we review five currently available biome maps for South America, including the WWF Ecoregions, the Americas basemap, the Land Cover Map of South America, Morrone\u2019s Biogeographic regions of Latin America, and the Ecological Systems Map. The comparison is performed through a case study on the Seasonally Dry Tropical Forest (SDTF) biome using herbarium data of habitat specialist species. Results Current biome maps of South America perform poorly in depicting SDTF distribution. The poor performance of the maps can be attributed to two main factors: (1) poor spatial resolution, and (2) poor biome delimitation. Poor spatial resolution strongly limits the use of some of the maps in GIS applications, especially for areas with heterogeneous landscape such as the Andes. Whilst the Land Cover Map did not suffer from poor spatial resolution, it showed poor delimitation of biomes. The results highlight that delimiting structurally heterogeneous vegetation is difficult based on remote sensed data alone. A new refined working map of South American SDTF biome is proposed, derived using the Biome Distribution Modelling (BDM) approach where georeferenced herbarium data is used in conjunction with bioclimatic data. Conclusions Georeferenced specimen data play potentially an important role in biome mapping. Our study shows that herbarium data could be used as a way of ground-truthing biome maps in silico. The results also illustrate that herbarium data can be used to model vegetation maps through predictive modelling. The BDM approach is a promising new method in biome mapping, and could be particularly useful for mapping poorly known, fragmented, or degraded vegetation. We wish to highlight that biome delimitation is not an exact science, and that transparency is needed on how biomes are used as study units in macroevolutionary and ecological research.","uuid":"84e50621-0ab3-384b-a1c3-be04cab594dd","authors":[{"forename":"Tiina","surname":"Sarkinen"},{"forename":"Joao R.
