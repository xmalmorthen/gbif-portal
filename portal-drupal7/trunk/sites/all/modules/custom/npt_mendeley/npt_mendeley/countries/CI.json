Recent studies conducted from January to June 2007 and in 2008 identified two new locations in the region of Marahou\u00e9 (department of Bouafl\u00e9), relatively far from the previously known ones and confirmed the disappearance of the species in Mounts Tonkpi and Boho. The distribution of this species was mapped and some ecological characteristics observed in those different locations were specified. The conservation status of the species was also assessed and discussed on the basis of the threats that its habitats were liable to, using the criteria of the IUCN Red List. The species can be characterized as rare in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.","uuid":"627c47f7-0f76-3c08-95a8-1012e642d62e","authors":[{"forename":"Yao Adou","surname":"C.Y."},{"forename":"N\u2019Da D.","surname":"H."},{"forename":"Bakayoko","surname":"A."},{"forename":"Kouassi K.","surname":"E."},{"forename":"N\u2019Guessan K.","surname":"E."},{"forename":"","surname":"Ak\u00e9- Assi L."}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"C.Y."}]
