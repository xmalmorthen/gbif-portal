Methods We reviewed various national and sub-national vegetation maps for their potential in increasing the resolution of the African map. Associated documentation was consulted to compile species assemblages, and to identify indicator species, for national forest vegetation types. Indicator species were identified for each regional forest type by selecting those species that, among all the species listed for the same phytochorion (regional centre of endemism), were listed only for that forest type. For each of the national forest types, we counted the number of indicator species of the anticipated regional type. Floristic relationships (expressed by four different ecological distance measures) among national forest types were investigated based on distance-based redundancy analysis, permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) using distance matrices and hierarchical clustering. Results For most of the national forests, the analysis of indicator species and floristic relationships confirmed the regional classification system for the majority of national forest types, including the allocation to different phytochoria. Permutation tests confirmed allocation of national forest types to regional typologies, although the number of possible permutations limited inferences for the Zambezian and Lake Victoria phytochoria. Two forest types from Ethiopia and Kenya did not correspond to regional forest types.&#4; Conclusions Our analysis provides support that as the classification systems are compatible, the resolution and information content of the vegetation map of Africa can be directly improved by adding information from national maps, probably leading to improved liability of its application domains. We found statistical evidence for a distinct Afromontane phytochorion. We suggest expanding the regional forest classification system with \u2018Afromontane moist transitional forest\u2019. Among the various application domains of the higher resolution maps, these maps allow for an enhanced phytochoristic analysis of eastern Africa.","uuid":"81c4d26a-20ed-3208-8c19-7187773482a1","authors":[{"forename":"Roeland","surname":"Kindt"},{"forename":"Jens-Peter B.","surname":"Lilles\u00f8"},{"forename":"Paulo","surname":"van Breugel"},{"forename":"Michael","surname":"Bingham"},{"forename":"Sebsebe","surname":"Demissew"},{"forename":"Cornell","surname":"Dudley"},{"forename":"Ib","surname":"Friis"},{"forename":"Francis","surname":"Gachathi"},{"forename":"James","surname":"Kalema"},{"forename":"Frank","surname":"Mbago"},{"forename":"Heriel N.","surname":"Moshi"},{"forename":"John W.","surname":"Mulumba"},{"forename":"Mary","surname":"Namaganda"},{"forename":"Henry J.","surname":"Ndangalasi"},{"forename":"Christopher K.","surname":"Ruffo"},{"forename":"V\u00e9daste","surname":"Minani"},{"forename":"Ramni H.","surname":"Jamnadass"},{"forename":"Lars","surname":"Graudal"}],"editors":[{"forename":"Tim","surname":"O'Connor"}],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Kindt"},{"id":"6016477044","title":"Potential distribution of threatened Leptopelis spp. (Anura, Arthroleptidae) in Ethiopia derived from climate and land-cover data","type":"Journal Article","volume":"9","url":"http:\/\/www.int-res.com\/articles\/esr2009\/9\/n009p117.pdf","tags":["2010","amphibians","CH","conservation","DE","ET","Ethiopia","GBIF_used","Germany","museum","niche_modeling","SDM","Switzerland","university"],"keywords":["Ecological niche modeling \u00b7 Maxent \u00b7 Threatened sp","hotspot analysis"],"pages":"117\u2013124","year":"2010","abstract":"Ethiopia harbours 9 species of threatened amphibians, all of which inhabit the high- lands. Over the last decades, there has been a rapid increase in deforestation and habitat degrada- tion in Ethiopia, with the result that the last undisturbed refuges for forest-dwelling anurans in the mountain areas have shrunk noticeably, especially outside of protected areas. In the present study, we used a maximum entropy ecological niche modelling approach to model the potential distribution of 2 poorly known Leptopelis species. The models were derived from climate and land cover data at known occurrences of the species (i.e. data from a number of natural history museums). These mod- els can be used to select the priority areas most critical for future protection and may guide further field surveys to accelerate the discovery of unknown populations.","edition":"Jan 11, 20","uuid":"cf0eca46-5dba-38a8-a922-411f69a8372e","authors":[{"forename":"Frank","surname":"Weinsheimer"},{"forename":"Abebe A.","surname":"Mengistu"},{"forename":"Dennis","surname":"R\u00f6dder"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Endangered Species Research","firstAuthor":"Weinsheimer"}]
