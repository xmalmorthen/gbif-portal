The species discussed in this paper are the following: Palaeocyanus crassifolius (Bertoloni) Dost\u00e1l; Cremnophyton lanfrancoi Brullo and Pavone; Helichrysum melitense (Pignatti) Brullo, Lanfranco, Pavone and Ronsisvalle; Linaria pseudolaxiflora Lojacono; Asparagus horridus L. and Allium sphaerocephalon subsp. arvense (Guss.) Arcang. The first four are species found in article 17 of the Maltese habitats and species, listed in the annexes of the Habitats Directive by the European Commission. Asparagus horridus and Allium sphaerocephalon subsp. arvense are recent additions to the flora of Malta, and their distribution is given in this account. Discussion on the distribution and observations on the preferred habitat are given for each species supplemented by recommendations for the red data book.","uuid":"ce0d32ad-584b-3693-85fb-70945348f24d","authors":[{"forename":"Stephen","surname":"Mifsud"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Mifsud"}]
