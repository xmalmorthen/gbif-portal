Only two taxa were found on the original slides, Surirella approximataWoodhead & Tweed and S. engleri [var. constricta]f. minor Woodhead & Tweed. The valve variability of S. engleri O. M\u00fcller includes valves of S. engleri [var. constricta]f. minor which is now regarded as a synonym. As no holotypes were indicated by the authors, types are given here. Comments on S. rudis var. sierra-leonensis Woodhead & Tweed, S. rudis [var. sierra-leonensis]f. constricta Woodhead & Tweed and S. esamangensis Foged are also given.
