This process has left few written records, and little research has been done on transatlantic plant use. We used the composition of aphrodisiac mixtures across the black Atlantic to discuss the adaptation of herbal medicine by African diaspora in the New World. Since Africans are considered relatively recent migrants in America, their healing flora is often said to consist largely of pantropical and cultivated species, with few native trees. Therefore, we expected Caribbean recipes to be dominated by taxa that occur in both continents, poor in forest species and rich in weeds and domesticated exotics.","uuid":"6d2c9d83-37d5-30b6-99c8-30ba6f408003","authors":[{"forename":"Tinde van","surname":"Andel"},{"forename":"Sylvia","surname":"Mitchell"},{"forename":"Gabriele","surname":"Volpato"},{"forename":"Ina","surname":"Vandebroek"},{"forename":"Jorik","surname":"Swier"},{"forename":"Sofie","surname":"Ruysschaert"},{"forename":"Carlos Ariel","surname":"Renter\u00eda Jim\u00e9nez"},{"forename":"Niels","surname":"Raes"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Journal of Ethnopharmacology","firstAuthor":"Andel"},{"id":"6016483974","title":"Detailed Food Web Networks of Three Greater Antillean Coral Reef Systems: The Cayman Islands, Cuba, and Jamaica","type":"Journal Article","volume":"2013","url":"http:\/\/www.datasets.com\/journals\/ecology\/2013\/857470\/","tags":["2012","Aichi_B","California Academy of Sciences","Cuba_biodiversity","GBIF_used","Jamaica_biodiversity","marine","Target_10","The Cayman Islands_biodiversity","US"],"keywords":[],"pages":"1-9","year":"2012","abstract":"Food webs represent one of the most complex aspects of community biotic interactions. Complex food webs are represented as networks of interspecific interactions, where nodes represent species or groups of species, and links are predator-prey interactions. This paper presents reconstructions of coral reef food webs in three Greater Antillean regions of the Caribbean: the Cayman Islands, Cuba, and Jamaica. Though not taxonomically comprehensive, each food web nevertheless comprises producers and consumers, single-celled and multicellular organisms, and species foraging on reefs and adjacent seagrass beds. Species are grouped into trophic guilds if their prey and predator links are indistinguishable. The data list guilds, taxonomic composition, prey guilds\/species, and predators. Primary producer and invertebrate richness are regionally uniform, but vertebrate richness varies on the basis of more detailed occurrence data. Each region comprises 169 primary producers, 513 protistan and invertebrate consumer species, and 159, 178, and 170 vertebrate species in the Cayman Islands, Cuba, and Jamaica, respectively. Caribbean coral reefs are among the world's most endangered by anthropogenic activities. The datasets presented here will facilitate comparisons of historical and regional variation, the assessment of impacts of species loss and invasion, and the application of food webs to ecosystem analyses.","uuid":"4612d946-06d1-3017-8496-9214ced07137","authors":[{"forename":"Peter","surname":"Roopnarine"},{"forename":"Rachel","surname":"Hertog"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Roopnarine"}]
