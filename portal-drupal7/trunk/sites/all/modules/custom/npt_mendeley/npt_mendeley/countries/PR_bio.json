Progress achieving Target two has been hampered by the large number of plant species and the difficulty assembling the data needed for Red List assessments. Two streamlined methods for identifying those plant species considered At Risk under the GSPC Target two are compared and contrasted. Both methods use readily available locality data from herbarium specimens to efficiently identify At Risk species and approximate the list of species that would be identified as threatened by Red List analyses. A comprehensive analysis of the native plant species of Puerto Rico using both streamlined methods identifies 570 of the 2,025 species at some risk of extinction. More efficient systems for assessing threat allow a more timely response to Target two, allow conser- vation efforts to be directed to the species that need attention, and the list of threatened plants can be used to identify priority areas for plant conservation.","uuid":"673a335a-fb17-3e7c-a22a-87a665aebdab","authors":[{"forename":"James S.","surname":"Miller"},{"forename":"Holly A.","surname":"Porter-Morgan"},{"forename":"Hannah","surname":"Stevens"},{"forename":"Brian","surname":"Boom"},{"forename":"Gary A.","surname":"Krupnick"},{"forename":"Pedro","surname":"Acevedo-Rodr\u00edguez"},{"forename":"James","surname":"Fleming"},{"forename":"Micah","surname":"Gensler"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Biodiversity & Conservation","firstAuthor":"Miller"}]
