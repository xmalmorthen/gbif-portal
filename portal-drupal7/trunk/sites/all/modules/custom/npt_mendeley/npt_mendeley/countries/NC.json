(Amborellaceae, Amborellales), the sole living member of the sister group to all other extant Angiosperms, is endemic to New Caledonia. We addressed the intraspecific phylogeography of Amborella by investigating whether its present population genetic structure could be related to its current and past habitats. We found moderate range-wide genetic diversity based on nuclear microsatellite data, and detected four well-differentiated, geographically distinct genetic groups using Bayesian clustering analyses. We modeled the ecological niche of Amborella based on current climatic and environmental conditions. The predictive ability of the model was very good throughout the Central East mainland zone, but Amborella was predicted in the northern part of the island where this plant has not been reported. Furthermore, no significant barrier was detected based on habitat suitability that could explain the genetic differentiation across the area. Conversely, we found that the main genetic clusters could be related to the distribution of suitable habitat at the last glacial maximum (LGM, ca. 21 000 years BP), when Amborella experienced a dramatic 96.5% reduction in suitable area. At least two lineages survived in distinct putative refugia located in the Massif des L\u00e8vres and in the vicinity of Mount Aoupini\u00e9. Our findings finally confirmed the importance of LGM rainforest refugia in shaping the current intra- and inter-specific diversity in New Caledonian plants, and revealed the possibility of an as-yet unreported refugium. The combination of niche modelling and population genetics thereby offered novel insight into the biogeographic history of an emblematic taxon. This article is protected by copyright.

To assist this process, we compare four methods for marine spatial planning of Madagascar's west coast. Input data for each method was drawn from the same variables: fishing pressure, exposure to climate change, and biodiversity (habitats, species distributions, biological richness, and biodiversity value). The first method compares visual color classifications of primary variables, the second uses binary combinations of these variables to produce a categorical classification of management actions, the third is a target-based optimization using Marxan, and the fourth is conservation ranking with Zonation. We present results from each method, and compare the latter three approaches for spatial coverage, biodiversity representation, fishing cost and persistence probability. All results included large areas in the north, central, and southern parts of western Madagascar. Achieving 30% representation targets with Marxan required twice the fish catch loss than the categorical method. The categorical classification and Zonation do not consider targets for conservation features. However, when we reduced Marxan targets to 16.3%, matching the representation level of the \u201cstrict protection\u201d class of the categorical result, the methods show similar catch losses. The management category portfolio has complete coverage, and presents several management recommendations including strict protection. Zonation produces rapid conservation rankings across large, diverse datasets. Marxan is useful for identifying strict protected areas that meet representation targets, and minimize exposure probabilities for conservation features at low economic cost. We show that methods based on Zonation and a simple combination of variables can produce results comparable to Marxan for species representation and catch losses, demonstrating the value of comparing alternative approaches during initial stages of the planning process. Choosing an appropriate approach ultimately depends on scientific and political factors including representation targets, likelihood of adoption, and persistence goals.","uuid":"c3ff65a8-bcd9-3362-b33d-38ec11f0de87","authors":[{"forename":"Thomas F.","surname":"Allnutt"},{"forename":"Timothy R.","surname":"McClanahan"},{"forename":"Serge","surname":"Andr\u00e9fou\u00ebt"},{"forename":"Merrill","surname":"Baker"},{"forename":"Erwann","surname":"Lagabrielle"},{"forename":"Caleb","surname":"McClennen"},{"forename":"Andry J.
