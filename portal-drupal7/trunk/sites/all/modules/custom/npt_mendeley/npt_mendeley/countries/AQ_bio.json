However, the zoogeographical affinities of several taxa from South America and Antarctica have been subject to debate, bringing into question the extent of Antarctic isolation. Here we present new data on bryozoan species and their spatial distribution in the Argentine Patagonian (AP) region, as well as an analysis of the bryozoological similarities between deep ranges from Argentina and neighbouring regions. A total of 108 species of cheilostome bryozoans (378 samples), belonging to 59 genera was found. Five new genera and 36 new species were found in the AP region, while 71 species were reported for the first time from Argentina. The bathymetric ranges of 94 species (87 %) were expanded and a high proportion of the identified species (44.4 %) also had an Antarctic distribution. The bryozoological affinities found in the current study between the nearest geographical neighbours are in agreement with the hypothesis of the sequential separation of Gondwana during the Cenozoic. Moreover, a high number of shared species, mainly from the slope, were found in this study between the AP region and Antarctica, thus supporting the idea that the Southern Ocean may have been less isolated over geological time than once thought.","uuid":"55508308-1753-3858-b15a-ade027d5bad0","authors":[{"forename":"Blanca","surname":"Figuerola"},{"forename":"Dennis P.","surname":"Gordon"},{"forename":"Virginia","surname":"Polonio"},{"forename":"Javier","surname":"Cristobo"},{"forename":"Conxita","surname":"Avila"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Figuerola"},{"id":"6016481764","title":"Antarctic Crabs: Invasion or Endurance?","type":"Journal Article","volume":"8","issue":"7","url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0066981","tags":["2013","Aichi_B","Antarctica_biodiversity","GB","GBIF_primary","GBIF_used","GBIF_VIP","GBits_9","invasive","marine","Target_9"],"keywords":[],"pages":"e66981","year":"2013","abstract":"Recent scientific interest following the \u201cdiscovery\u201d of lithodid crabs around Antarctica has centred on a hypothesis that these crabs might be poised to invade the Antarctic shelf if the recent warming trend continues, potentially decimating its native fauna. This \u201cinvasion hypothesis\u201d suggests that decapod crabs were driven out of Antarctica 40\u201315 million years ago and are only now returning as \u201cwarm\u201d enough habitats become available. The hypothesis is based on a geographically and spatially poor fossil record of a different group of crabs (Brachyura), and examination of relatively few Recent lithodid samples from the Antarctic slope. In this paper, we examine the existing lithodid fossil record and present the distribution and biogeographic patterns derived from over 16,000 records of Recent Southern Hemisphere crabs and lobsters. Globally, the lithodid fossil record consists of only two known specimens, neither of which comes from the Antarctic. Recent records show that 22 species of crabs and lobsters have been reported from the Southern Ocean, with 12 species found south of 60\u00b0S. All are restricted to waters warmer than 0\u00b0C, with their Antarctic distribution limited to the areas of seafloor dominated by Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW). Currently, CDW extends further and shallower onto the West Antarctic shelf than the known distribution ranges of most lithodid species examined. Geological evidence suggests that West Antarctic shelf could have been available for colonisation during the last 9,000 years. Distribution patterns, species richness, and levels of endemism all suggest that, rather than becoming extinct and recently re-invading from outside Antarctica, the lithodid crabs have likely persisted, and even radiated, on or near to Antarctic slope. We conclude there is no evidence for a modern-day \u201ccrab invasion\u201d. We recommend a repeated targeted lithodid sampling program along the West Antarctic shelf to fully test the validity of the \u201cinvasion hypothesis\u201d.","uuid":"f9d3b25c-6e84-302b-a3d2-bc32cbb5b557","authors":[{"forename":"Huw J.","surname":"Griffiths"},{"forename":"Rowan J.","surname":"Whittle"},{"forename":"Stephen J.","surname":"Roberts"},{"forename":"Mark","surname":"Belchier"},{"forename":"Katrin","surname":"Linse"}],"editors":[{"forename":"Philippe","surname":"Archambault"}],"publication_outlet":"PloS one","firstAuthor":"Griffiths"},{"id":"6116588384","title":"Low global sensitivity of metabolic rate to temperature in calcified marine invertebrates","type":"Journal Article","url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24036933","tags":["2013","Aichi_E","Antarctica_biodiversity","Arctic_biodiversity","AU","Australia","Australia_biodiversity","ecology","GB","GBIF_primary","GBIF_used","GBits_10","GB_biodiversity","Great Britain","in_press","New Zealand","New Zealand_biodiversity","NZ","SG","Singapore","Singapore_biodiversity","Target_19"],"keywords":[],"year":"2013","abstract":"Metabolic rate is a key component of energy budgets that scales with body size and varies with large-scale environmental geographical patterns. Here we conduct an analysis of standard metabolic rates (SMR) of marine ectotherms across a 70\u00b0 latitudinal gradient in both hemispheres that spanned collection temperatures of 0-30 \u00b0C. To account for latitudinal differences in the size and skeletal composition between species, SMR was mass normalized to that of a standard-sized (223 mg) ash-free dry mass individual. SMR was measured for 17 species of calcified invertebrates (bivalves, gastropods, urchins and brachiopods), using a single consistent methodology, including 11 species whose SMR was described for the first time. SMR of 15 out of 17 species had a mass-scaling exponent between 2\/3 and 1, with no greater support for a 3\/4 rather than a 2\/3 scaling exponent. After accounting for taxonomy and variability in parameter estimates among species using variance-weighted linear mixed effects modelling, temperature sensitivity of SMR had an activation energy (Ea) of 0.16 for both Northern and Southern Hemisphere species which was lower than predicted under the metabolic theory of ecology (Ea 0.2-1.2 eV). Northern Hemisphere species, however, had a higher SMR at each habitat temperature, but a lower mass-scaling exponent relative to SMR. Evolutionary trade-offs that may be driving differences in metabolic rate (such as metabolic cold adaptation of Northern Hemisphere species) will have important impacts on species abilities to respond to changing environments.","uuid":"194e4898-d387-38cc-ae67-3f371e02a79a","authors":[{"forename":"Sue-Ann","surname":"Watson"},{"forename":"Simon A.","surname":"Morley"},{"forename":"Amanda E.","surname":"Bates"},{"forename":"Melody S.","surname":"Clark"},{"forename":"Robert W.","surname":"Day"},{"forename":"Miles","surname":"Lamare"},{"forename":"Stephanie M.","surname":"Martin"},{"forename":"Paul C.","surname":"Southgate"},{"forename":"Koh Siang","surname":"Tan"},{"forename":"Paul A.","surname":"Tyler"},{"forename":"Lloyd S.","surname":"Peck"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Watson"}]
