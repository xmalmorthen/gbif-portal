In this study, we analyze the effects of a seemingly nonpermeable matrix on the population structure of the forest-dwelling butterfly Pararge aegeria in geographically isolated oases at the northern margin of the Sahara desert using microsatellites, morphological characters, and species distribution modeling. Results from all analyses are mostly congruent and reveal 1) a split between European and North African populations, 2) rather low divergence between populations from the eastern and western part of North Africa (Morocco vs. Tunisia), 3) a lack of differentiation between the oasis and Atlas Mountain populations, 4) as well as among the oasis populations, and 5) no reduction of genetic variability in oasis populations. However, one exception to this general trend resulted from the analyses of wing shape; wings of butterflies from oases are more elongated compared with those from the other habitats. This pattern of phenotypic divergence may suggest a recent colonization of the oasis habitats by individuals, which might be accompanied by a rather dispersive behavior. Species distribution modeling suggests a fairly recent reexpansion of the species' climatic niche starting in the Holocene at about 6000 before present. The combined results indicate a rather recent colonization of the oases by highly mobile individuals from genetically diverse founder populations. The colonization was likely followed by the expansion and persistence of these founder populations under relatively stable environmental conditions. This, together with low rates of gene flow, likely prevented differentiation of populations via drift and led to the maintenance of high genetic diversity.","uuid":"516480b9-c315-313a-8ae8-7aec2ff31bc6","authors":[{"forename":"Jan Christian","surname":"Habel"},{"forename":"Martin","surname":"Husemann"},{"forename":"Thomas","surname":"Schmitt"},{"forename":"Leonardo","surname":"Dapporto"},{"forename":"Dennis","surname":"R\u00f6dder"},{"forename":"Sofie","surname":"Vandewoestijne"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"The Journal of heredity","firstAuthor":"Habel"},{"id":"6016484664","title":"Climate change impact on seaweed meadow distribution in the North Atlantic rocky intertidal","type":"Journal Article","url":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1002\/ece3.541","tags":["2013","Aichi_B","AU","Australia","BE","Belgium","GBIF_used","GBits_8","in_press","marine","Maxent","Netherlands","NL","NO","North Atlantic_biodiversity","Norway","SDM","Target_10","US"],"keywords":["ascophyllum","ecological niche models","fucus","geographic distribution","global warming","intertidal","macroalgae","species distribution"],"year":"2013","abstract":"The North-Atlantic has warmed faster than all other ocean basins and climate change scenarios predict sea surface temperature isotherms to shift up to 600 km northwards by the end of the 21st century.

We asked the question: Where will climate change have the greatest impact on three foundational, macroalgal species that occur along North-Atlantic shores: Fucus serratus, Fucus vesiculosus, and Ascophyllum nodo- sum? To predict distributional changes of these key species under three IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) climate change scenarios (A2, A1B, and B1) over the coming two centuries, we generated Ecological Niche Models with the program MAXENT.

Previous research suggested that environmental forcing results in highly congruent regionalization patterns across taxa, but that the size and number of regions depends on the dispersal ability of the taxa considered. We produced a biogeographic regionalization of European bryophytes and hypothesized that (1) regions defined for bryophytes would differ from those defined for other taxa due to the highly specific eco-physiology of the group and (2) their high dispersal ability would result in the resolution of few, large regions. Species distributions were recorded using 10,000 km(2) MGRS pixels. Because of the lack of data across large portions of the area, species distribution models employing macroclimatic variables as predictors were used to determine the potential composition of empty pixels. K-means clustering analyses of the pixels based on their potential species composition were employed to define biogeographic regions. The optimal number of regions was determined by v-fold cross-validation and Moran's I statistic. The spatial congruence of the regions identified from their potential bryophyte assemblages with large-scale vegetation patterns is at odds with our primary hypothesis. This reinforces the notion that post-glacial migration patterns might have been much more similar in bryophytes and vascular plants than previously thought. The substantially lower optimal number of clusters and the absence of nested patterns within the main biogeographic regions, as compared to identical analyses in vascular plants, support our second hypothesis. The modelling approach implemented here is, however, based on many assumptions that are discussed but can only be tested when additional data on species distributions become available, highlighting the substantial importance of developing integrated mapping projects for all taxa in key biogeographically areas of Europe, and the Mediterranean peninsulas in particular.","uuid":"f5d9cd9a-28ca-3ce8-a7df-8c25b38f2f61","authors":[{"forename":"Rub\u00e9n G.","surname":"Mateo"},{"forename":"Alain","surname":"Vanderpoorten"},{"forename":"Jes\u00fas","surname":"Mu\u00f1oz"},{"forename":"Benjamin","surname":"Laenen"},{"forename":"Aur\u00e9lie","surname":"D\u00e9samor\u00e9"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Mateo"},{"id":"6016483064","title":"Conservation Priorities for Prunus africana Defined with the Aid of Spatial Analysis of Genetic Data and Climatic Variables","type":"Journal Article","volume":"8","issue":"3","url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0059987","tags":["2013","Africa_biodiversity","Aichi_C","Aichi_E","AT","Austria","BE","Belgium","Bioversity","CO","Colombia","conservation","GBIF_used","GBits_8","IT","Italy","KE","Kenya","Maxent","plants","SDM","Target_12","Target_18"],"keywords":[],"pages":"e59987","year":"2013","abstract":"Conservation priorities for Prunus africana, a tree species found across Afromontane regions, which is of great commercial interest internationally and of local value for rural communities, were defined with the aid of spatial analyses applied to a set of georeferenced molecular marker data (chloroplast and nuclear microsatellites) from 32 populations in 9 African countries. Two approaches for the selection of priority populations for conservation were used, differing in the way they optimize representation of intra-specific diversity of P. africana across a minimum number of populations. The first method (S1) was aimed at maximizing genetic diversity of the conservation units and their distinctiveness with regard to climatic conditions, the second method (S2) at optimizing representativeness of the genetic diversity found throughout the species\u2019 range. Populations in East African countries (especially Kenya and Tanzania) were found to be of great conservation value, as suggested by previous findings. These populations are complemented by those in Madagascar and Cameroon. The combination of the two methods for prioritization led to the identification of a set of 6 priority populations. The potential distribution of P. africana was then modeled based on a dataset of 1,500 georeferenced observations. This enabled an assessment of whether the priority populations identified are exposed to threats from agricultural expansion and climate change, and whether they are located within the boundaries of protected areas. The range of the species has been affected by past climate change and the modeled distribution of P. africana indicates that the species is likely to be negatively affected in future, with an expected decrease in distribution by 2050. Based on these insights, further research at the regional and national scale is recommended, in order to strengthen P. africana conservation efforts.","uuid":"94835341-933e-324a-9094-680d017f9471","authors":[{"forename":"Barbara","surname":"Vinceti"},{"forename":"Judy","surname":"Loo"},{"forename":"Hannes","surname":"Gaisberger"},{"forename":"Maarten J.","surname":"van Zonneveld"},{"forename":"Silvio","surname":"Schueler"},{"forename":"Heino","surname":"Konrad"},{"forename":"Caroline a.

Within problem formulation, the insecticidal trait, the crop, the receiving environment, and protection goals were characterized, and a conceptual model was developed to identify routes through which aquatic organisms may be exposed to insecticidal proteins in maize tissue. Following a tiered approach for exposure assessment, worst-case exposures were estimated using standardized models, and factors mitigating exposure were described. Based on exposure estimates, shredders were identified as the functional group most likely to be exposed to insecticidal proteins. However, even using worst-case assumptions, the exposure of shredders to Bt maize was low and studies supporting the current risk assessments were deemed adequate. Determining if early tier toxicity studies are necessary to inform the risk assessment for a specific GM crop should be done on a case by case basis, and should be guided by thorough problem formulation and exposure assessment. The processes used to develop the Bt maize case study are intended to serve as a model for performing risk assessments on future traits and crops.","uuid":"e35486bb-9372-3f20-8e6f-cc24005e31e4","authors":[{"forename":"Keri","surname":"Carstens"},{"forename":"Jennifer","surname":"Anderson"},{"forename":"Pamela","surname":"Bachman"},{"forename":"Adinda","surname":"De Schrijver"},{"forename":"Galen","surname":"Dively"},{"forename":"Brian","surname":"Federici"},{"forename":"Mick","surname":"Hamer"},{"forename":"Marco","surname":"Gielkens"},{"forename":"Peter","surname":"Jensen"},{"forename":"William","surname":"Lamp"},{"forename":"Stefan","surname":"Rauschen"},{"forename":"Geoff","surname":"Ridley"},{"forename":"J\u00f6rg","surname":"Romeis"},{"forename":"Annabel","surname":"Waggoner"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Transgenic Research","firstAuthor":"Carstens"},{"id":"6016482344","title":"Unravelling the evolutionary history of the polyploid complex Ranunculus parnassiifolius (Ranunculaceae)","type":"Journal Article","volume":"107","issue":"3","url":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/j.1095-8312.2012.01968.x","tags":["2012","Aichi_E","BE","Belgium","ES","European_biodiversity","GBIF_used","plants","Spain","Target_19","university"],"keywords":["biogeography","character tracing","molecular phylogenetics"],"pages":"477-493","year":"2012","abstract":"Ranunculus L. represents the largest genus within Ranunculaceae, comprising more than 600 species with a worldwide distribution.

Location Macaronesia, Mediterranean, Atlantic fringe of Europe. Methods Patterns of genetic diversity are described based on variation at two chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) loci and one nuclear DNA (nDNA) locus for 109 accessions across the entire distribution range of the species. Global patterns of genetic differentiation were investigated using principal coordinates analysis. Genetic differentiation between island and continental areas, estimations of pollen- and seed-mediated gene flow, and the presence of phylogeographical signal were assessed by means of Fst\/NST (continental scale) and Fij\/Nij (local scale). Extant and past distribution ranges of the species were inferred from niche modelling using layers describing present and Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) macroclimatic conditions. Results The Azores exhibited a significantly higher genetic diversity than the continent. The lowest levels of genetic differentiation were observed between the Azores and the western Mediterranean, and the diversity observed in the Azores resulted from at least two colonization waves. Within the Azores, kinship coefficients showed a significant and much steeper decrease with geographical distance in the cpDNA than in the nDNA. The distribution predicted by LGM models was markedly different from the current potential distribution, particularly in western Europe, where no suitable areas were predicted by LGM models, and along the Atlantic coast of the African continent, where LGM models predicted highly suitable climatic conditions. Main conclusions The higher diversity observed in Azorean than in continental populations is inconsistent with MacArthur and Wilson\u2019s equilibrium model and derived theoretical population genetic expectations. This inverted pattern may be the result of extinction on the continent coupled with multiple island colonization events and subsequent allopatric diversification and lineage hybridization in the Azores. The results highlight the role of allopatric diversification in explaining diversification on islands and suggest that this process has played a much more significant role in shaping Azorean biodiversity than previously thought.","uuid":"29778d10-33ff-3fe2-a049-6c1e6afc42ee","authors":[{"forename":"Aur\u00e9lie","surname":"D\u00e9samor\u00e9"},{"forename":"B.","surname":"Laenen"},{"forename":"Juana-Mar\u00eda","surname":"Gonz\u00e1lez-Mancebo"},{"forename":"R.","surname":"Ja\u00e9n Molina"},{"forename":"Nadia","surname":"Bystriakova"},{"forename":"E.","surname":"Martinez-Klimova"},{"forename":"M.

We developed an extensive database of locality records of one of Africa\u2019s most conspicuous groups, the acacias (the genera Senegalia and Vachellia), and used species distribution models (SDMs) to estimate the distribution of all African acacias. 3. African acacias are particularly well adapted against mammalian herbivory; therefore, we hypothesized that browser diversity could be an important driver of acacia richness. Species richness maps for the two genera were created from SDM-generated maps. Ordinary least square (OLS) regressions and, to consider spatial autocorrelation, simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) analyses were used to model richness of the two genera in relation to mammalian browser richness, current environment (including climate), and climate history since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). We used variation partitioning to determine what percentage of variation could be explained by these three groups of factors. 4. Both genera showed centres of richness in East Africa and the Limpopo Basin of southern Africa. Browser richness was the best explanatory variable for richness of both genera. Environmental factors explained negligible variation in the richness of Senegalia, but some variation in Vachellia. For both genera, the residuals of the species richness model of one genus also explained much variation in the richness of the other genus, indicating that common factors not considered in the richness analyses here may additionally be driving the richness of both genera. 5.

However, cacao\u2019s distribution of genetic diversity in South America is also likely to reflect pre-Columbian human influences that were superimposed on natural processes of genetic differentiation. Here we present the results of a spatial analysis of the intra-specific diversity of cacao in Latin America, drawing on a dataset of 939 cacao trees genotypically characterized by means of 96 SSR markers. To assess continental diversity patterns we performed grid-based calculations of allelic richness, Shannon diversity and Nei gene diversity, and distinguished different spatially coherent genetic groups by means of cluster analysis. The highest levels of genetic diversity were observed in the Upper Amazon areas from southern Peru to the Ecuadorian Amazon and the border areas between Colombia, Peru and Brazil. On the assumption that the last glaciation (22,000\u201313,000 BP) had the greatest pre-human impact on the current distribution and diversity of cacao, we modeled the species\u2019 Pleistocene niche suitability and overlaid this with present-day diversity maps. The results suggest that cacao was already widely distributed in the Western Amazon before the onset of glaciation. During glaciations, cacao populations were likely to have been restricted to several refugia where they probably underwent genetic differentiation, resulting in a number of genetic clusters which are representative for, or closest related to, the original wild cacao populations. The analyses also suggested that genetic differentiation and geographical distribution of a number of other clusters seem to have been significantly affected by processes of human management and accompanying genetic bottlenecks. We discuss the implications of these results for future germplasm collection and in situ, on farm and ex situ conservation of cacao.","uuid":"321c88a7-d478-3413-8d9f-6091c8d0b747","authors":[{"forename":"Evert","surname":"Thomas"},{"forename":"Maarten van","surname":"Zonneveld"},{"forename":"Judy","surname":"Loo"},{"forename":"Toby","surname":"Hodgkin"},{"forename":"Gea","surname":"Galluzzi"},{"forename":"Jacob van","surname":"Etten"}],"editors":[{"forename":"Dorian Q.","surname":"Fuller"}],"publication_outlet":"PLoS ONE","firstAuthor":"Thomas"},{"id":"6016484604","title":"Relative embryo length as an adaptation to habitat and life cycle in Apiaceae","type":"Journal Article","volume":"195","issue":"2","url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22621412","tags":["2012","Aichi_E","BE","Belgium","DE","GB","GBIF_used","Germany","Kew Gardens","species distribution","Target_19","university"],"keywords":["Adaptation","Apiaceae","Apiaceae: growth & development","Apiaceae: physiology","Climate","Ecosystem","Germination","Germination: physiology","Heritable","Least-Squares Analysis","Likelihood Functions","Phylogeny","Physiological","Quantitative Trait","Regression Analysis","Seeds","Seeds: anatomy & histology","Seeds: physiology"],"pages":"479-87","year":"2012","abstract":"\u2022 The factors driving the evolution of the relative embryo length in Apiaceae were examined.

Considering that (1) queries with a large genetic distance with their best DNA barcode match are more likely to be misidentified and (2) imposing a distance threshold profitably reduces identification errors, we modelled relationships between identification performances and distance thresholds in four DNA barcode libraries of Diptera (n = 4270), Lepidoptera (n = 7577), Hymenoptera (n = 2067) and Tephritidae (n = 602 DNA barcodes). In all cases, more restrictive distance thresholds produced a gradual increase in the proportion of true negatives, a gradual decrease of false positives and more abrupt variations in the proportions of true positives and false negatives. More restrictive distance thresholds improved precision, yet negatively affected accuracy due to the higher proportions of queries discarded (viz. having a distance query-best match above the threshold). Using a simple linear regression we calculated an ad hoc distance threshold for the tephritid library producing an estimated relative identification error <0.05. According to the expectations, when we used this threshold for the identification of 188 independently collected tephritids, less than 5% of queries with a distance query-best match below the threshold were misidentified. Ad hoc thresholds can be calculated for each particular reference library of DNA barcodes and should be used as cut-off mark defining whether we can proceed identifying the query with a known estimated error probability (e.g. 5%) or whether we should discard the query and consider alternative\/complementary identification methods.","uuid":"945c0163-e4da-30bd-be5f-1a41f2ed59c8","authors":[{"forename":"Massimiliano","surname":"Virgilio"},{"forename":"Kurt","surname":"Jordaens"},{"forename":"Floris C.","surname":"Breman"},{"forename":"Thierry","surname":"Backeljau"},{"forename":"Marc","surname":"De Meyer"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"PLoS ONE","firstAuthor":"Virgilio"},{"id":"6016480424","title":"How many species in the Southern Ocean?

To allow assessing the known biodiversity, SCAR-MarBIN \"Register of Antarctic Marine Species (RAMS)\" was compiled and published by a panel of 64 taxonomic experts. Thanks to this outstanding expertise mobilized for the first time, an accurate list of more than 8100 valid species was compiled and an up-to-date systematic classification comprising more than 16,800 taxon names was established. This taxonomic information is progressively and systematically completed by species occurrence data, provided by literature, taxonomic and biogeographic databases, new data from CAML and other cruises, and museum collections. RAMS primary role was to establish a benchmark of the present taxonomic knowledge of the Southern Ocean biodiversity, particularly important in the context of the growing realization of potential impacts of the global change on Antarctic ecosystems. This, in turn, allowed detecting gaps in knowledge, taxonomic treatment and coverage, and estimating the importance of the taxonomic impediment, as well as the needs for more complete and efficient taxonomic tools. A second, but not less important, role of RAMS was to contribute to the \"taxonomic backbone\" of the SCAR-MarBIN, OBIS and GBIF networks, to establish a dynamic information system on Antarctic marine biodiversity for the future. The unknown part of the Southern Ocean biodiversity was approached by pointing out what remains to be explored and described in terms of geographical locations and bathymetric zones, habitats, or size classes of organisms. The growing importance of cryptic species is stressed, as they are more and more often detected by molecular studies in several taxa. Relying on RAMS results and on some case studies of particular model groups, the question of the potential number of species that remains to be discovered in the Southern Ocean is discussed. In terms of taxonomic inputs to the census of Southern Ocean biodiversity, the current rate of progress in inventorying the Antarctic marine species as well as the state of taxonomic resources and capacity were assessed. Different ways of improving the taxonomic inputs are suggested.","uuid":"58effb72-9f20-3b70-b000-8df6826ca24e","authors":[{"forename":"Claude","surname":"De Broyer"},{"forename":"Bruno","surname":"Danis"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Deep Sea Research Part II: Topical Studies in Oceanography","firstAuthor":"De Broyer"},{"id":"6016479864","title":"From Africa to Europe and back: refugia and range shifts cause high genetic differentiation in the Marbled White butterfly Melanargia galathea","type":"Journal Article","volume":"11","issue":"1","url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21777453\nhttp:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2148\/11\/215","tags":["2011","BE","Belgium","DE","GBIF_used","Germany","LU","Luxembourg","museum","niche_modeling","SDM","university"],"keywords":["allozyme electrophoresis","barriers","climate envelope modelling","climatic oscillations","Melanargia galathea","Melanargia lachesis","phylogeography"],"pages":"215","year":"2011","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","abstract":"BACKGROUND: The glacial-interglacial oscillations caused severe range modifications of biota. Thermophilic species became extinct in the North and survived in southern retreats, e.g. the Mediterranean Basin. These repeated extinction and (re)colonisation events led to long-term isolation and intermixing of populations and thus resulted in strong genetic imprints in many European species therefore being composed of several genetic lineages. To better understand these cycles of repeated expansion and retraction, we selected the Marbled White butterfly Melanargia galathea. Fourty-one populations scattered over Europe and the Maghreb and one population of the sibling taxon M. lachesis were analysed using allozyme electrophoresis. RESULTS: We obtained seven distinct lineages applying neighbour joining and STRUCTURE analyses: (i) Morocco, (ii) Tunisia, (iii) Sicily, (iv) Italy and southern France, (v) eastern Balkans extending to Central Europe, (vi) western Balkans with western Carpathian Basin as well as (vii) south-western Alps. The hierarchy of these splits is well matching the chronology of glacial and interglacial cycles since the Gunz ice age starting with an initial split between the galathea group in North Africa and the lachesis group in Iberia. These genetic structures were compared with past distribution patterns during the last glacial stage calculated with distribution models. CONCLUSIONS: Both methods suggest climatically suitable areas in the Maghreb and the southern European peninsulas with distinct refugia during the last glacial period and underpin strong range expansions to the North during the Postglacial. However, the allozyme patterns reveal biogeographical structures not detected by distribution modelling as two distinct refugia in the Maghreb, two or more distinct refugia at the Balkans and a close link between the eastern Maghreb and Sicily. Furthermore, the genetically highly diverse western Maghreb might have acted as source or speciation centre of this taxon, while the eastern, genetically impoverished Maghreb population might result from a relatively recent recolonisation from Europe via Sicily.","uuid":"246b5045-80ab-37c8-9413-b8e935692b0e","authors":[{"forename":"Jan Christian","surname":"Habel"},{"forename":"Luc","surname":"Lens"},{"forename":"Dennis","surname":"R\u00f6dder"},{"forename":"Thomas","surname":"Schmitt"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"BMC evolutionary biology","firstAuthor":"Habel"},{"id":"6016479694","title":"Oceanic islands are not sinks of biodiversity in spore-producing plants","type":"Journal Article","volume":"108","issue":"47","url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22084108\nhttp:\/\/www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov\/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3223459&tool=pmcentrez&rendertype=abstract","tags":["2011","BE","Belgium","biogeography","climate","ES","GBIF_used","GBIF_VIP","herbarium","niche_modeling","SDM","Spain","university","US"],"keywords":["Atlantic Islands","Biodiversity","Biological","Bryopsida","Bryopsida: genetics","Bryopsida: physiology","Demography","Flow Cytometry","Genetic Variation","Genetics","Ice Cover","Linkage Disequilibrium","Microsatellite Repeats","Microsatellite Repeats: genetics","Models","Phylogeography","Population","Population Dynamics","Portugal","Spain"],"pages":"18989-94","year":"2011","abstract":"Islands have traditionally been considered as migratory and evolutionary dead ends for two main reasons: island colonizers are typically assumed to lose their dispersal power, and continental back colonization has been regarded as unlikely because of niche preemption. The hypothesis that islands might actually represent dynamic refugia and migratory stepping stones for species that are effective dispersers, and in particular, for spore-producing plants, is formally tested here, using the archipelagos of the Azores, Canary Islands, and Madeira, as a model. Population genetic analyses based on nuclear microsatellite variation indicate that dispersal ability of the moss Platyhypnidium riparioides does not decrease in the island setting. The analyses further show that, unlike island populations, mainland (southwestern Europe and North Africa) populations underwent a severe bottleneck during the last glacial maximum (LGM). Our results thus refute the traditional view of islands as the end of the colonization road and point to a different perception of North Atlantic archipelagos as major sources of biodiversity for the postglacial recolonization of Europe by spore-producing plants.","uuid":"67508f6b-70c1-31cc-9f9a-6c715844fb85","authors":[{"forename":"Virginie","surname":"Hutsem\u00e9kers"},{"forename":"P\u00e9ter","surname":"Sz\u00f6v\u00e9nyi"},{"forename":"A.

Although divergences in nuclear DNA content among different species within a genus are widely acknowledged, intraspecific variation is still a somewhat controversial issue. Holoploid and monoploid genome sizes (C- and Cx-values) were determined using propidium iodide flow cytometry in 125 plants of R. parnassifolius s.l. distributed across four European countries. Three different DNA ploidy levels were revealed in the study area: diploid (2n \u223c 2x, 57.14%), triploid (2n \u223c 3x, 1.19%), and tetraploid (2n \u223c 4x, 41.67%). The mean population 2C-values ranged from 8.15 pg in diploids to 14.80 pg in tetraploids, representing a ratio of 1 : 1.8. Marked intraspecific\/interpopulation differences in nuclear DNA content were found. Diploid populations prevail in the Pyrenees, although tetraploid cytotypes were reported throughout the distribution area. In general, mixed-cytotype populations were not found. The Spearman correlation coefficient did not reveal significant correlations between genome size and altitude, longitude, or latitude. Morphometric analyses and cluster analyses based on genome size variation revealed the presence of three major groups, which exhibited a particular biogeographical pattern. A new cytotype, DNA triploid, was found for the first time. Tetraploid populations showed constant nuclear DNA levels, whereas diploid populations from the Pyrenees, in which introgressive hybridization is suggested as a presumable trigger for genome size variation, did not.

Orchids have complex and delicate interactions with their pollinators, which makes them particularly prone to local extinction. Conservation actions should be encouraged for a range of endangered Mediterranean orchid species, but the current taxonomic confusion in several genera and the apparent disagreement among orchid taxonomists make the situation particularly confusing from a conservation perspective. In this review, we document how the different pollination syndromes of Mediterranean orchids (nectar reward, shelter offering, food deception and sexual deception) can have a profound impact on the type of reproductive barriers among species, on floral phenotypic variation as we perceive it, on potentially related processes of species sorting and extinction and, consequently, should have a strong influence on the related conservation management programs. We also highlight that the majority of Mediterranean orchids are pollinated by specialised bees often occupying otherwise narrow ecological niches (e.g. pollen specialisation, brood cell parasites, specific nesting site). This condition makes the orchid-pollinator interactions very fragile and several orchid species prone to local extinction. We illustrate this phenomenon by a selection of case studies that show how the adequate integration of the ecological requirements\/traits of the orchids and their associated pollinators into conservation actions could help protect endangered species and ensure the sustainability of the often complex local pollination web.","uuid":"10a57252-8d3b-3225-b0f3-73b4c01d844b","authors":[{"forename":"Nicolas","surname":"Vereecken"},{"forename":"Amots","surname":"Dafni"},{"forename":"Salvatore","surname":"Cozzolino"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"The Botanical Review","firstAuthor":"Vereecken"},{"id":"6016477334","title":"Bioinformatics interoperability: all together now !","type":"Journal Article","volume":"54","url":"http:\/\/www.ingentaconnect.com\/content\/nhn\/blumea\/2009\/00000054\/F0030001\/art00005","tags":["2009","BE","Belgium","GBIF_used","informatics"],"keywords":[],"pages":"16-17","year":"2009","uuid":"7d280227-6c9d-34d8-af77-8d6db2b2a6bf","authors":[{"forename":"B.","surname":"Meganck"},{"forename":"P.","surname":"Mergen"},{"forename":"D.","surname":"Meirte"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Meganck"},{"id":"6016476234","title":"Establishment success of invasive ring-necked and monk parakeets in Europe","type":"Journal Article","volume":"36","issue":"12","url":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/j.1365-2699.2009.02177.x","tags":["2009","BE","Belgium","Belgium_biodiversity","birds","GBIF_used","Maxent","niche_modeling","SDM"],"keywords":["Climate-matching hypothesis","establishment success","Europe","human-activity hypothesis","invasive alien species","monk parakeet","Myiopsitta monachus","Psittacidae","Psittacula krameri","ring-necked parakeet"],"pages":"2264-2278","year":"2009","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","abstract":"Abstract Aim Invasive alien species are a growing threat to biodiversity, and identifying the mechanisms that enable these species to establish viable populations in their new environment is paramount for management of the problems they pose. Using an unusually large number of both failed and successful documented introductions of parakeets (Aves: Psittacidae) in Europe, we test two of the major hypotheses on the establishment success of invading species, namely the climate-matching and the human-activity hypothesis. Location European human population centres where ring-necked parakeet (Psittacula krameri) and\/or monk parakeet (Myiopsitta monachus) introductions have occurred. Methods Data on ring-necked and monk parakeet introductions in Europe were gathered from various sources, including published books and articles, but also from unpublished reports and local grey literature. Information was verified with experts from the region under consideration. In order to test the climate-matching hypothesis, we verified whether the climatic factors that determine the parakeets\u2019 native ranges also explain establishment success in Europe. Parakeet occurrence data from the native ranges were analysed using the presence-only modelling method Maxent, and correlations between parakeet establishment and climatic and anthropogenic variables in Europe were assessed using both stepwise logistic regression and the information-theoretic model selection approach. Results The establishment success of ring-necked and monk parakeets was found to be positively associated with human population density, and, both in the native and in the introduced regions, parakeet occurrence was negatively correlated with the number of frost days. Thus, parakeets are more likely to establish in warmer and human-dominated areas. Main conclusions The large number of independent parakeet introductions in Europe allows us to test the often-used climate-matching and human-activity hypotheses at the species level. We show that both hypotheses offer insight into the invasion process of monk and ring-necked parakeets. Our results suggest that, in the future, parakeet establishment probability may increase even further because global warming is likely to cause a decrease in the number of frost days and because urbanization and human populations are still increasing.","uuid":"28780e7a-ac4b-3426-b914-eb385691d17c","authors":[{"forename":"Diederik","surname":"Strubbe"},{"forename":"Erik","surname":"Matthysen"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"Journal of Biogeography","firstAuthor":"Strubbe"}]
