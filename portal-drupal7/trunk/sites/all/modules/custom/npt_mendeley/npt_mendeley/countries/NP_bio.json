The shape of (hitherto rarely found) apothecia and pycnospores (the latter observed for the first time) are illustrated and compared with those of European material of P. glauca. TLC analyses of P. erosa samples revealed two substances, hitherto unknown in Platismatia, namely pannaric acid and jackinic acid, the latter also found in fruiting material of Platismatia glauca from Europe. Two chemotypes of P. erosa are recognized: chemotype I with caperatic acid as main fatty acid, and chemotype II (found only once) with jackinic acid as main aliphatic substance.","uuid":"6743c75c-2462-312a-9f91-bfc697dbe5cf","authors":[{"forename":"Walter","surname":"Obermayer"},{"forename":"Tiina","surname":"Randlane"}],"editors":[],"publication_outlet":"[Pending journal name]","firstAuthor":"Obermayer"}]
