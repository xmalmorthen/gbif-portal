These instructions guide you through recreating the tiles for the base maps in use on the home page.

1) Download TileMill and install it.  
2) Create a new TileMill project, and include the default world layer, using default everything (e.g. 24-bit PNG) 
3) Take the pattern-sea and pattern-land from this folder and put them on a public HTTP URL (dropbox perhaps?)
4) Edit your styles.mss like so (or change to whatever you want):

Map {
  background-image: url("http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/608155/map/pattern-sea.png");
}

#countries {
  line-color: #325D2B;
   line-width: 1;  
  line-join: round;
  polygon-fill: #569D4A;
  polygon-pattern-file: url("http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/608155/map/pattern-land.png")
}

5) Save it - you should have a preview which looks like the final result
6) Export (top right) as MBTiles
7) We only need zoom 0-4, otherwise defaults are good
8) Convert the MBTiles to PNGs.  Google it, but I used https://github.com/mapbox/mbutil by downloading it and then:
  ./mb-util /tmp/countries_922e12.mbtiles /tmp/tiles
  
9) Copy the tiles into this folder.
10) Bask in map glory
